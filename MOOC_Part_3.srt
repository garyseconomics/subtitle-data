1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,200
Today we are going to do part

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,200
three in our educational series,

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,440
Understanding Wealth Inequality and The Economy.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,400
And we're going to explain why

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,280
economists don't talk about wealth inequality.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:15,840
Okay.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,360
So in the first two videos in this series

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,080
we explained firstly what is wealth.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,800
Secondly, what is wealth inequality

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,640
and why it is destroying our living standards

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,640
and making people poorer?

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,920
Today's video we're going to explain

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,680
if wealth inequality is so important,

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,400
why is it that other economists don't talk about it?

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,160
Okay, so the first

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,120
reason economists don't talk about inequality

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,400
is because of the way

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,800
economics is taught at universities.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
So for those who don't know, I studied

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,480
maths and economics at the London School

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,720
of Economics for three years, my undergrad.

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,520
And then I did a two year

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,240
master's in economics at Oxford.

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,040
So I've spent five years in the economics departments

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
learning economics

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,960
and I think it's important to understand

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,120
the way that economics

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,520
is taught at universities nowadays.

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,400
So the first thing to say is,

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
and I think this will surprise a lot of people,

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,440
in economics departments

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,200
we don't talk about the housing crisis.

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
We don't talk about why housing is unaffordable.

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
We don't talk about falling living standards.

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,160
We don't talk about why wages are falling,

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,720
why it's hard to get a good job,

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,840
why big cities are expensive,

39
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,560
why things like energy

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,440
and food are increasingly expensive.

41
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,320
These kind of big economic

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,000
problems of our time

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,320
are basically not discussed at university.

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,000
So what do we do at university?

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,880
The main thing is we do maths.

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,000
So economics nowadays is a very,

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,440
very heavily mathmatised subject.

48
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,120
If you don't have a very good maths A-level,

49
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,880
you basically can't even get into university to do it.

50
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,840
And then when you get into the university

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
it's just very, very, very heavily mathematical.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
And once you go into postgrad especially,

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,680
it's extremely, phenomenally mathematical

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
and it's not easy maths.

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,840
You're doing kind of a lot of algebra,

56
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,680
a lot of simultaneous equations.

57
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,760
But basically it's a maths subject at this point.

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
And it's important to say that the maths is

59
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,120
not easy.

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,880
So I had a maths and economics undergrad

61
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,520
and I was very good at maths as a kid.

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,760
But then when I went to do my postgrad at Oxford,

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,920
even though I was very good at maths,

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,400
I found the maths quite difficult.

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,600
And if you want to succeed,

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,360
if you want to get good grades,

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
you really, really have to spend a lot of time

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,680
memorizing the maths basically.

69
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,280
And the context for this maths is they basically build

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,400
a model, like a model economy

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
and everything affects everything else.

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,200
So if we cut the interest rate a bit,

73
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,080
what does that do to GDP for example?

74
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,920
Or if people suddenly start

75
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,200
spending less money trying to save more,

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
what does that do to inflation?

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,360
This kind of thing.

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,440
If the government suddenly raises taxes,

79
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,520
how does that affect the economy?

80
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,320
And you build this kind of mathematical model?

81
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,680
It's like a kind of like a toy model,

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,240
like a kind of game in a way.

83
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,880
We raise this a little bit,

84
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,440
that falls, this thing rises.

85
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,880
And that's the kind of model

86
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,200
that is basically used in modern economics.

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,680
But of course,

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,920
when you build a model,

89
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,800
you can't include absolutely everything

90
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,760
that exists in the economy.

91
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,640
You have to make some simplifications,

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,800
some things will be included,

93
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,560
some things will not be included.

94
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,160
And

95
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,600
the models which we study at universities nowadays,

96
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,040
one of the big simplifications

97
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,000
is that there is no inequality in the model.

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,640
In fact,

99
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,760
it's more than just that

100
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,880
there is no inequality in the model.

101
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,400
There is only one person in the model.

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
So these models are what

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,680
they call representative agent models.

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,600
So rather than looking at 6

105
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
or 7 billion people in the world,

106
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,400
or like 66 million people in the UK,

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,360
or 300 million people in the US,

108
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,120
they say

109
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,440
to make the model simpler,

110
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,680
we are just going to look at one representative person.

111
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,880
So the average person in the whole economy.

112
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,680
So all you care about is averages, right?

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,040
You're just looking at one average person.

114
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
And of course

115
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
if we change the distribution,

116
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,920
if I take some wealth from you

117
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,080
and give it to Bill Gates, or if I take some wealth

118
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,480
from Rishi Sunak and give it to you,

119
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
that changes the distribution

120
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,640
but doesn't change the average.

121
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,120
So basically, once you build this model,

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,040
which only looks at the representative agent,

123
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,720
which is the average, which is the aggregate,

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
it's not only that

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,000
there is no inequality in the model.

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
There is

127
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,480
not even any possibility for inequality in the model.

128
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,760
These are models of averages.

129
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,720
These are models of aggregates.

130
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,640
Which is why

131
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,800
when modern economists

132
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,760
you've been to these elite universities

133
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,080
think about the economy,

134
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,160
they tend to think about them

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
in terms of averages or aggregates,

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,920
so that they're obsessed with the big aggregate

137
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,480
measurements of the economy.

138
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,800
For example, GDP is, of course,

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,240
the classic one, unemployment,

140
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,680
inflation, central bank interest rates,

141
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,560
level of government

142
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,640
spending, level of government taxation.

143
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,000
These are things which you can measure

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
on an aggregate economy.

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,200
But they're nothing to do with

146
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,880
how is one person affected versus another person?

147
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,960
As soon as you take a model

148
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,560
and you make it

149
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,960
representative agent, a model of the average person,

150
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,400
this model can't say anything about distribution.

151
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,160
It can't say anything about this

152
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,200
group of people is winning.

153
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
This group of people is losing.

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,360
We can't say anything like that in these models.

155
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,600
So I think this is really interesting, right.

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Because when you...

157
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,920
if you want to be like

158
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,440
an influential economist

159
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,400
in the world of policy or academia,

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,680
you are going to have to have a PhD.

161
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,160
So you're going to have to have three years undergrad,

162
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
one year, I did two years master,

163
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,640
you're going to be doing a PhD

164
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
for like three, four, five years.

165
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,280
In the US, a PhD like seven years.

166
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,600
You're going to have to do

167
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,760
like some postdoc work, and then you're going to,

168
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,720
if you're lucky, become a junior professor.

169
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,160
So by the time you reach a point that you are,

170
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,680
like influential in economic policy terms.

171
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,320
You've been studying these models

172
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,280
for like 15 years, like, something like that.

173
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,320
And the fact that these models

174
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,680
don't include any distribution,

175
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,800
don't include any inequality

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
that doesn't explicitly say, we don't think

177
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,880
inequality is important,

178
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,000
but what does it do

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
to a person

180
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
who has devoted

181
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,720
most of their life to the study of economics,

182
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,760
that that study has consisted of

183
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,880
10 - 15 years of very difficult

184
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,080
mathematical analysis, mathematical manipulation

185
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,440
of very difficult, very complicated mathematical models

186
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,480
with no inequality in them.

187
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,200
Like, I think this is actually...

188
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,440
this is a very effective way

189
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,200
to subconsciously

190
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,560
convince, almost subconsciously brainwash a person

191
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,920
into believing that inequality doesn't matter.

192
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,000
You never come out and explicitly say like,

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,480
inequality doesn't matter.

194
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
But you say like, here's

195
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,080
a really,

196
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,560
really complicated game, here's

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,800
a really,

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,280
really complicated mathematical model,

199
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,200
that you're going to have to spend

200
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,440
15 or 20 years of your life

201
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,280
understanding in absolute fine detail,

202
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,000
and you never even explicitly mention it,

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,080
but the model doesn't have inequality in it,

204
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
doesn't have any distribution.

205
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,760
It doesn't have any space for that.

206
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,440
So imagine you’re

207
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,760
that that kid, you went in 18 years old,

208
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,200
and then you spent 15 years of your life paying,

209
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,080
you know, locked in libraries,

210
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,480
doing really difficult maths

211
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,640
with no inequality, no inequality, no inequality.

212
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,240
And then...

213
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,400
first of

214
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,760
all, whenever you

215
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
think about what's wrong with the economy,

216
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,760
you're going to go back to this stuff

217
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,480
you studied, right?

218
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,200
And you're going to be like,

219
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,120
maybe the problem is the interest rate is too high

220
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,880
or government spending is too low,

221
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,360
or government taxation is too high.

222
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,400
You know, you're going to focus on these things

223
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,080
that were in the model.

224
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,640
You spent 20 years studying that model.

225
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,000
Of course, you're going to want to provide answers

226
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that often the model that you told,

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,160
the model that has been spent...

228
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
you've been spending 20 years of your life studying.

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,040
But if somebody comes to you

230
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,080
and says, hey,

231
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
maybe the problem is inequality,

232
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,280
maybe the problem is distribution, how is that going to

233
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,400
affect you emotionally?

234
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,040
What's your emotional response to that going to be?

235
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,080
I think you're going to get like a gut instinct,

236
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,120
which is like, no, of course it's not.

237
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,000
It's not that.

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,480
Because if it was that,

239
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,720
why the f**k have I spent 20 years

240
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
studying something that's not even in the model?

241
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,560
And also

242
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,320
you kind of have a bit of professional skin

243
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,120
in this game, right?

244
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
Because if this person is right

245
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,720
with what they're saying, that the reason

246
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,400
the economy gets worse and

247
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,680
worse is because of growing inequality,

248
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,280
then you have spent 20 years of your life

249
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,880
studying something that has nothing to say

250
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,760
about the biggest economic issue of our time.

251
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,760
And you are a professor now at Chicago or LSE

252
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,760
or some fancy university.

253
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
And you've got nothing to say about this.

254
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,200
If this is true, you're in big trouble, right?

255
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
So I think this is

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,840
the current way that we teach economics

257
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,760
is very, very powerful

258
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,000
at convincing everyone who has a powerful voice

259
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,160
in speaking about economics,

260
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,640
in insisting no, that's not it.

261
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,160
That's not it, that's not it, that's not it.

262
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,800
But the end result is, you know,

263
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,960
most of these discussions are just,

264
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,040
you know, ten people

265
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,520
with elite university degrees talking to each other.

266
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
So it's not that

267
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,800
they even have to really deny somebody like me

268
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,920
who says inequality is the problem.

269
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
It just never in the discussion.

270
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,360
It's never, never in the discussion.

271
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,240
It's a little bit like,

272
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,200
you know, you know who Copernicus is.

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,080
Copernicus, this scientist who discovered that

274
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,240
the earth travels around the sun

275
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
and the earth is just one of many planets

276
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,680
traveling around the sun.

277
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,240
And, everybody accepts now that this is right.

278
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,400
But before him,

279
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,880
everybody thought that the earth

280
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,400
was the center of the solar system.

281
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,160
I guess it probably wasn't

282
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,480
called the solar system at that time.

283
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,600
And everything traveled around that, including the sun.

284
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
And they had developed

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,960
these really complicated mathematical systems

286
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,880
of making that work.

287
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,160
And the way that works is that all the other planets

288
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
they have to do, like loop

289
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,280
the loops and spinning around,

290
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,680
that's the only way that it works to make sense.

291
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,600
So what are these guys spent like their whole lives

292
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,400
working on these complicated mathematical models

293
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
of how everything goes around the earth,

294
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,880
and then a guy came and said,

295
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,960
actually things that go around the earth.

296
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,720
And he was,

297
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,920
you know, he was massively, massively attacked.

298
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,240
Nobody wanted to accept it because

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
you have all these

300
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,280
prestigious academics who have spent their whole life

301
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,160
developing models

302
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,920
of how things travel around the earth.

303
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,000
I think that's kind of basically where we are now.

304
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,400
And if I was right in saying that,

305
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,240
that these guys are just missing the big thing,

306
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
what would you expect?

307
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,040
You would expect basically, that their models

308
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,320
wouldn't work in the sense that

309
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,800
they would constantly generate incorrect predictions.

310
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,440
And that is exactly what happens.

311
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,400
These guys consistently generate incorrect predictions.

312
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,200
So, you know,

313
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,840
I've spoken about it many times on this channel,

314
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,600
and I'll speak about it

315
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,880
on the next video in the course.

316
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
My job was

317
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,520
to predict interest rates, and interest rates are...

318
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,680
modern economists are basically obsessed

319
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,560
with interest rates.

320
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,920
Before 2008,

321
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,880
they basically thought

322
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,720
you could

323
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,800
solve pretty much any modern economic problem

324
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,640
by just making sure you get that interest rate right.

325
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,440
And if you look at the way that our economists

326
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,080
react to financial crises and economic crises,

327
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,240
how do they react to 2008? Sashed the interest rate.

328
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
How did they react to Covid? Slashed the interest rate.

329
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
How did they react to the inflationary

330
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,280
spike after Covid? Rocketed the interest rate up.

331
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,600
This is basically where

332
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,640
our economists sit at the moment,

333
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,440
which is the way to deal with

334
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,120
any economic crisis is to manipulate the interest rate.

335
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,680
So the interest rate is like their key tool

336
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,160
that they use basically.

337
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,640
And yet

338
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,720
what are their predictions

339
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,920
for their own interest rate like?

340
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,880
So I was an impression

341
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,480
interest rate trader from 2008 until 2014.

342
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,600
In 2008, after the financial crisis,

343
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,400
interest rates were slashed to zero

344
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,320
in basically the whole of the rich world.

345
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,760
Nobody predicted that, that was a surprise.

346
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
And because they believe

347
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,600
that low interest rates

348
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
are very economically stimulative,

349
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,720
they thought that rates would come up again

350
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,480
the next year.

351
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,160
They didn't.

352
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,080
They then said in 2009, well,

353
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,440
we were wrong

354
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,040
this year, but rates will come up next year.

355
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,880
They didn't.

356
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,840
In 2010 they said rates will go up in 2011.

357
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,600
They didn't.

358
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
And they continued to predict rates

359
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
to go up every single year

360
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,160
up until 2020 in the middle of Covid.

361
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,200
Every single one of those predictions were incorrect.

362
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
And then they finally said, in the midst of Covid,

363
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,960
now inflation is so low

364
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,200
and will stay so

365
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
low for so long,

366
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,720
interest rates will never go up again,

367
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
and interest rates immediately went up to 5% or 6%.

368
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,800
So you know,

369
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,640
I know when I come out and say

370
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,080
inequality is the big thing.

371
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,600
And you live in a world

372
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,560
full of economists

373
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,960
that say,

374
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,560
oh the problem is things to do with the interest rate,

375
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,640
things to do with levels of government

376
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,800
spending, things to do with the level of taxation.

377
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,920
I can sound like a bit of a quack, basically.

378
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,840
Why is this guy

379
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,400
saying the problem is one thing

380
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,360
when all of these prestigious elite

381
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,040
economists aren’t mentioning it?

382
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,200
Well,

383
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
they're an educational system

384
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
which never talks about it

385
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,720
and their predictions are constantly wrong.

386
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,280
Whereas if you look at my predictions and, you know,

387
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,480
I correctly predicted interest rates

388
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
after the 2008 crisis,

389
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,520
but I've also correctly predicted things

390
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,120
on this channel.

391
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,680
If you go back and look at the first video

392
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,840
on this channel,

393
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,120
which we’ll link in the description,

394
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,800
I predicted in the beginning of Covid,

395
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,240
there would be an inflationary crisis,

396
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,600
a cost of living crisis,

397
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,520
a huge spike in the stock price,

398
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,240
the gold price, house prices

399
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,360
and huge increase in inequality.

400
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,600
All of these things have happened.

401
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,000
So I know it's easy to dismiss somebody,

402
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,240
especially somebody who doesn't come

403
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,520
from a rich, privileged background saying

404
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,040
the elites are wrong on this,

405
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,120
but the elites are continually

406
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,360
generating incorrect predictions,

407
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,920
and I'm generating correct predictions here.

408
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,960
So I think that

409
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,920
what we have at the moment is essentially

410
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,320
a broken education system in economics.

411
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,280
But there's more to it than that.

412
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,480
And the second reason

413
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,320
why we don't speak about inequality in economics enough

414
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,840
is because

415
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,880
we have a system

416
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,760
which

417
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,560
aggressively takes anybody who is good at predictions

418
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
out of the conversation.

419
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,240
And to explain this,

420
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,880
I want you to put yourself in the mind of

421
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,040
a young 20/21 year old

422
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,240
economics student,

423
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,320
loves economics, loves the maths, studying

424
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,200
it loads at an elite university.

425
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,920
You know, you graduate whatever it is, magna cum laude,

426
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,760
or whatever,

427
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,960
you're top of your class

428
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,520
and then you have to decide

429
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,680
what you want to do with your life.

430
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,440
So if you want to be in this conversation,

431
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,400
if you want to be an academic

432
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,680
or if you want to be advisor to government,

433
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,760
or if you want to work

434
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,200
in, you know, public policy,

435
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,640
you had to stay in academia,

436
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,040
you can't just do an undergrad.

437
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,840
You're going to have to do a master's.

438
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,960
It's going to cost you a lot of money.

439
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,160
You go and do a PhD.

440
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,640
You're going to have to work,

441
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,000
spend money, locked in libraries.

442
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,600
If you're lucky, you might start making money

443
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,800
in your like mid-thirties. Or you can go to the city.

444
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Not only does it pay you way, way, way more,

445
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,840
but it gives you the opportunity to prove,

446
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,600
look I'm good because I can make predictions.

447
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,120
And academia doesn't really care

448
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,160
if you can make good predictions. So one thing which

449
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
was really clear to me in my time in the city

450
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
and my time in academia, is

451
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,800
if you're really, really good,

452
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,240
you want to be in the city,

453
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,000
because if you're making good predictions,

454
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
you will be recognised,

455
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
you will be paid, and everybody will know

456
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
that is the guy over there who is right,

457
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,800
because they're really aggressively analysing

458
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,720
who is the guy who is making good predictions.

459
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,240
They're tracking that and they're paying that.

460
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Whereas when I went back to academia in 2017,

461
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,960
I had, you know, my first lecture at Oxford,

462
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,760
and it was about interest rates.

463
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,800
And I thought, you know, this is really interesting.

464
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,360
This is the thing which we've predicted really badly

465
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,600
for 10 - 15 years.

466
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,760
This is at the specific area I worked in.

467
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,280
This is the area I'm an expert on.

468
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,600
Like it's really interesting, right?

469
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
Like if you

470
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,440
are at an elite university

471
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,400
and you're studying something really important

472
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,120
and we've been wrong about it for 10...

473
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
at that time, it was 10 years.

474
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,720
Now it's more like 15 years.

475
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,120
This is interesting, right.

476
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
This is like a kind of an unsolved problem.

477
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,480
There's a thing that we're really bad at,

478
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,360
you know, we can work out why we bad at it.

479
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
So I went to the professor, I said,

480
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,040
why do you think we've been wrong

481
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,680
about interest rates for ten years?

482
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,160
And he said,

483
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,640
oh no, we always knew

484
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,520
interest rates would stay zero, which is,

485
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,040
you know, categorically wrong.

486
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,880
And I went back

487
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,200
and I showed him the data and I said,

488
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,080
look, you're actually been wrong for ten years.

489
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,240
And he said, oh, that's interesting.

490
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,400
You know, it never went anywhere.

491
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,200
So what this shows is, if you're good at predicting,

492
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,720
which means you’re,

493
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,000
you're good at working out other people are wrong,

494
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,800
the city will pay you, academia won't even notice.

495
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,080
They won't even notice.

496
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,320
So what does this tell you

497
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,480
about Academia's ability to improve?

498
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,920
Like if these guys are able to be wrong year

499
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,320
after year after year after year for 10 years

500
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,120
and not even notice

501
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,240
they're not going to improve,

502
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,520
they're not going to improve basically.

503
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,720
So what you have is a situation

504
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,480
where anyone who is good and wants to make money

505
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,920
is aggressively paid to leave.

506
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,680
And if you're good and you stay,

507
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,400
even if you are able to correctly identify

508
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,040
an area where everyone is consistently wrong,

509
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,520
they don't really care and they're not going to listen.

510
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,000
So what kind of person stays in academia

511
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
when they know that if they're good,

512
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,360
they will do much better and get paid much better

513
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,480
leaving academia and going into finance.

514
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,520
Basically people from rich families.

515
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,440
It doesn't make sense to do that

516
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,480
if you're not from a rich family.

517
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,240
Like if you are, if you have the option...

518
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,280
you know, I made millions of pounds in the city

519
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
and you know, that is what paid for this flat.

520
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,800
And, you know,

521
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,880
my brother needed to buy a house,

522
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
I helped him, my sister's

523
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,560
trying to buy a house, I'm helping her.

524
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,840
Like people from ordinary families

525
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,000
cannot afford to make that choice if they're good.

526
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,040
So the kind of people who stay in academia

527
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,560
you need to be either

528
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,520
not good enough to get into finance,

529
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,840
from a rich family, or basically a little bit mad.

530
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,320
And this is what happens.

531
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,520
So you have this system

532
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,200
which kind of brainwashes people

533
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
into saying inequality doesn't exist,

534
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,040
it doesn't matter,

535
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,640
doesn't listen to people who

536
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
are right and have wasted...

537
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
who are demonstrably better in their predictions

538
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,920
and aggressively takes everybody

539
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,320
who's half good out of the conversation.

540
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,760
And if you do go into finance, obviously,

541
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
then once you're in finance,

542
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,040
you can make a lot of money making good predictions,

543
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,360
but you're not allowed to speak publicly.

544
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,840
So when I was a trader,

545
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,320
I was making a lot of money

546
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,440
betting that inequality

547
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,200
would devastate living standards

548
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
and keep interest rates low

549
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,680
and push house prices up

550
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
and push stock prices up

551
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,600
and push inequality up further.

552
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,800
But I wasn't allowed to say anything

553
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,720
about these things.

554
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,600
I had another point which I need to make on this.

555
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,840
So the third reason economists

556
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
don't talk about inequality

557
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
is that

558
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,960
pretty much all powerful, influential economists

559
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,560
are quite rich.

560
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,360
They're quite rich,

561
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,920
they're generally from rich families.

562
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
If they weren't from rich families,

563
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,040
they probably wouldn't have stayed in academia.

564
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,200
Economics has the worst social representation

565
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,440
of, like, different social classes

566
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,120
of any subject in the big American universities.

567
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,720
So you have rich people who've gone into study

568
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,120
this subject, they probably don't need money,

569
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,200
otherwise they would have gone into finance.

570
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,840
And then they get paid to work

571
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,680
for a think tank or work for a newspaper.

572
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,040
And they themselves are quite rich and comfortable.

573
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,280
The people who pay them are probably quite rich.

574
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,640
They're heavily incentivised

575
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,880
not to talk about inequality, right.

576
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
In a quite obvious way,

577
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,200
which is when somebody is rich and comfortable,

578
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,160
they want to keep things the way they are.

579
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,040
You know, when you talk about a crisis of inequality,

580
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,360
it hurts most people quite badly

581
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,320
because, wealth tends to concentrate at the very top.

582
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,000
But there's a sort of, you know, the top

583
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
1% especially the top 0.1% does really, really well,

584
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,640
but there's like 5% or 6% of the top

585
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,240
that benefit from that.

586
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,560
And these guys

587
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,200
include basically any economist with a voice.

588
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
So economists are wealthy.

589
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,240
They don't want to do inequality.

590
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,880
They've got a massive amount of skin in the game

591
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,600
saying that inequality doesn't matter.

592
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,400
20 years,

593
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,440
30 years of education studying something

594
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
which has nothing to say about inequality.

595
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,960
They need this to not be a problem.

596
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,280
Okay.

597
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,880
So to conclude,

598
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,000
why do economists not talk about inequality?

599
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,160
Primarily it comes from an education system

600
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,440
which completely

601
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,600
neglects to discuss it,

602
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,280
which means that anyone who is involved in

603
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
this discussion has studied for 20 years

604
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,960
without ever talking about this.

605
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,720
So it basically indoctrinated them into believing

606
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,680
this is not a problem.

607
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,040
And also they have a massive incentive

608
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,400
in pushing that because otherwise

609
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,880
their basically, their education is a waste of time.

610
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,240
It's rich people.

611
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,160
It works for them and their class interests.

612
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,600
Anyone who is really good at

613
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,040
this is paid out of the game

614
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,640
and paid to keep their mouth shut.

615
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,880
So basically they're not going to fix this.

616
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,840
So what does that mean?

617
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,520
I'm filming this video at the back end of 2024.

618
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,840
We had an election this year

619
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,680
in the UK, where the center left

620
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,320
Labour Party beat the center right Conservative Party.

621
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,720
And I think

622
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,440
people often think that the reason that politicians

623
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,920
do nothing about inequality is because

624
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,560
they're representing their own interests.

625
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,120
It's important to recognise

626
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,080
there's kind of this whole class

627
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,920
of slightly self-serving,

628
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
slightly idiotic,

629
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,800
very posh, very rich economists

630
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,200
that are holding this up

631
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,400
and they're going to do nothing about inequality.

632
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,040
Inequality will get worse and worse.

633
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,680
Living standards for ordinary people will fall,

634
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,720
and these people are not going to stop it.

635
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
So the responsibility has to fall upon

636
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,440
ordinary people themselves to stop it.

637
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
When I first started talking

638
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,120
about these things publicly in 2020,

639
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,720
I was writing articles for newspapers.

640
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
I wrote an article for The Guardian,

641
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,360
and,

642
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,000
those articles are mainly being read

643
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,280
by quite posh, quite privileged, quite rich people.

644
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
And I was convinced

645
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,760
that we were not going to get positive change

646
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,320
by talking to the group of people

647
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,840
who benefit from the growth in inequality.

648
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,680
So I made consciously the switch to YouTube

649
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,320
to try to convince ordinary people

650
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,520
they need to do something.

651
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
And that's why we're doing, this channel.

652
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,000
So I would encourage people to support

653
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,440
keep watching these videos.

654
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,080
I think the next video we would do on this,

655
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,520
will be

656
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,440
a little bit talking about my personal experience

657
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,400
and how I came to become convinced

658
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
that inequality was the problem.

659
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,920
And then we'll keep doing

660
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,400
different educational bits and bobs

661
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,520
that will build up the understanding.

662
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,240
But that's it.

663
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,040
Part three of the conversation -

664
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,360
why economists never talk about inequality.

665
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,400
Because the universities train them not to.

666
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,160
