1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,200
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,880
Today

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,920
we are going to talk about

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,880
revenue raising and redistribution.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,480
Okay.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,240
Today I'm going to dispel

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,160
a couple of the common myths about tax.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,720
So we exist

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,400
in a country and increasingly

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,560
a world where governments

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,920
can't pay for the things they need

12
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,120
because they don't have any money.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,080
So people are talking about how can we raise money?

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,640
And when I talk about taxing the rich,

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
people think that it's mainly about revenue raising.

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,600
This is true.

17
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,400
It's true.

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,040
Increasingly we are in a situation

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
where the middle class are very squeezed

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,320
and they don't have much money.

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,640
So if you want to actually provide

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,560
decent public services,

23
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,280
you have to go after the very rich.

24
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,040
But I don't actually push for taxation

25
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,200
because I want to raise revenue.

26
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
The reason I push for taxation

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,640
is because ever since I was a trader in the early 2000,

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,040
I realised that the economy wouldn’t recover

29
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,680
because wealth was being transferred

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,280
very quickly from the middle class

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,160
and from government to the super rich.

32
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,880
If the middle class loses its wealth

33
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,000
and the government loses its wealth,

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,240
the economy will lose its spending

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,320
power, wages will collapse,

36
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,680
the rich will become very rich,

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
and asset prices will go through the roof.

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,880
This is the world we are living in.

39
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,040
Unless you are very rich,

40
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,720
your family and your government is losing its wealth

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,480
and you are becoming poor.

42
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,160
For me, tax, whilst revenue raising is a factor,

43
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,400
tax is primarily

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
about protecting ordinary people

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
from the rich and stopping wealth transfer

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,760
from ordinary people to the rich.

47
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,160
Listen, unless you're very rich,

48
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,840
the assets you own now

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
will not be owned by your kids and your grandkids.

50
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Those assets will pass to the very rich

51
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,520
because they have enormous amounts of passive income,

52
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,920
which their kids can use to outcompete your kids.

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,360
And your kids will end up owning nothing.

54
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,000
This is what I'm trying to avoid.

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,080
For me,

56
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,120
taxation is about protecting

57
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,920
the assets

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
of ordinary British families

59
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
and Americans and Australians

60
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
and all the other guys who are watching the channel.

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,880
It's not just about revenue

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,920
raising, tax is about defence,

63
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,840
defence, defence, defence.

64
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,480
I want you to view tax as equivalent to an army.

65
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,240
You have an army to defend yourself from other armies.

66
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,720
You have taxes to protect yourself from the rich.

67
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,440
We had taxes for a long time, and people like my dad

68
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,160
and my friends

69
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,200
dad could afford houses, your kids

70
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,240
and your grandkids will not be able to afford houses

71
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,560
because those houses will be bought by the rich.

72
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,360
The only way to protect yourself from

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
that is to tax the rich more.

74
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
It's not about revenue raising, it's about defence.

75
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
The next point is redistribution.

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,960
A lot of people don't like my channel

77
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,480
because they think I'm a communist

78
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,720
who is calling for redistribution.

79
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm not calling for redistribution.

80
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,800
The redistribution is happening.

81
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm trying to stop the redistribution.

82
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,280
Every year,

83
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
every decade, every generation,

84
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,080
the middle class and governments get poorer

85
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,600
and those assets gets transferred to the rich.

86
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,440
The government and ordinary families

87
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,560
end up deeper and deeper in debt to the rich.

88
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,760
This is a redistribution.

89
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
The redistribution is happening.

90
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
The middle class is dying.

91
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
They are being eaten by the rich.

92
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm not trying to redistribute wealth.

93
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,840
I'm trying to stop the redistribution of wealth

94
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,760
so that your kids and your grandkids

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,160
can have something to have kids of their own.

96
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,800
So to conclude, tax is not about revenue raising alone.

97
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,960
It's about defending yourself from the rich.

98
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,560
Redistribution from the rich to the poor

99
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,720
and the ordinary

100
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
might be nice in an ideal world,

101
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
but right now the main thing is to stop them

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,960
from eating your assets alive.

103
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,640
Protect yourself

104
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,880
from the rich, raise taxes on the super rich,

105
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,280
the hoarders of wealth, lower

106
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,840
taxes on ordinary working people.

107
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,520
Tell your friends, tell your mum, support the channel.

108
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,160
Thank you.
