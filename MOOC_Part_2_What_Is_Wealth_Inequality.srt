1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
Okay.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,720
Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

3
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,000
Today, we are going to do the second video

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,520
in our course on inequality and the economy.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,720
This one is called What is Wealth inequality?

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,880
And if we get time we'll go on

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,440
to how it affects the economy.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,760
This is really the heart of my economic understanding.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,480
It's what I make my money on.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,320
And it's really important for all of our videos,

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,320
so I hope you enjoy it.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,200
All right.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,760
So second video, first video was What is Wealth.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,920
And that was just explaining

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
that we're not talking about jobs.

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,920
We're not talking about income.

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,200
Wealth is about assets, physical assets.

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,280
Who owns the assets.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,080
So in this country it's

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,080
largely property, not just housing,

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,920
but also commercial property,

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,520
offices, shops, restaurants, bars,

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,960
factories, natural resources, like the farmland,

24
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,960
the

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,760
power plants.

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,760
So the generation of essentials like, food and energy.

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,440
Who owns those things and also debt.

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,240
So some people owe debt to other people.

29
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,880
That is wealth.

30
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,480
Not about jobs is about who owns the wealth.

31
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,320
And this video is going to be about

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,360
what is wealth inequality.

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,240
So when we talk about wealth inequality,

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,960
it's about who owns those things.

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,200
I think the best way to explain

36
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,880
this is through imagining

37
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,840
two separate kinds of economies.

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,280
One which is relatively wealth equal.

39
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,720
So all of that wealth is quite evenly distributed

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,040
throughout society.

41
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,800
And one which is very unequal.

42
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,200
So where all of that wealth is owned by,

43
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,080
you know, a small handful of families.

44
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,040
So in the wealth equal economy,

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,160
basically everyone's going to own like a big chunk of

46
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,040
the house they live in.

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,800
Everyone will pretty much own the house they live in,

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,160
but they're also going to own

49
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,760
a lot of the productive capacity in society.

50
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,440
So the way we see

51
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,600
that nowadays is basically

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
everybody has like a big stock portfolio.

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,120
So everybody owns their own house

54
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
or a chunk of their house.

55
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,640
And they also have like a stock portfolio,

56
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,400
which means they own some of the corporations.

57
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,320
Through those stocks they're going to own,

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,760
you know, some of the commercial property,

59
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,200
some of the buildings, some of the skyscrapers.

60
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,040
They'll also own a chunk of the natural resources.

61
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,440
So, they’s own a little bit of the farmland.

62
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,280
They’ll own some of the power production,

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
that's a wealth equal economy.

64
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,160
Everybody owns.

65
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,960
You know, not everybody's going to own the same stuff,

66
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,600
but everybody's got like a decent chunk of the wealth

67
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
that exists in the country.

68
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,280
That's the wealth equal economy.

69
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,320
Now, the wealth unequal economy.

70
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,080
This is where basically everything is owned by, like

71
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,840
a small elite.

72
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,400
You know, it could be,

73
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,760
you know, it could be a thousand people.

74
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
It could be,

75
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,880
it could be a million people, 1% of the country.

76
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
They own everything basically.

77
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,400
So in that economy, ordinary people don't own anything.

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,640
They don't have a stock portfolio,

79
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,680
they don't own their own house

80
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,200
so they're likely to be renting

81
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,400
or they're likely to be owning with a big mortgage.

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,760
and everything is owned by this small elite basically.

83
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,680
When you have this situation,

84
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
then what you get is

85
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
like significant transfer payments.

86
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,120
So when you have the equal economy,

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,560
there's not really a lot of transfer payments.

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,240
So if there are,

89
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,720
they sort of go around because okay,

90
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,000
maybe you own the shops

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,920
that I shop in,

92
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,120
but maybe I own the farm where your food comes from,

93
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,960
you know, sort of ends up kind of balancing out.

94
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
We all have a bit of passive income.

95
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,600
There's no significant transfer payments.

96
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
But once you have a very unequal economy,

97
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,360
you have these big transfer payments.

98
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,320
So let's assume I'm

99
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,960
sort of rich elite

100
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
and you're just like a regular person.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,480
One thing to recognise straight away is

102
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,960
the amount of wealth owned by the wealth owners

103
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,440
per person is much, much,

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,400
much higher in the unequal economy.

105
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,840
Because all of the wealth exists

106
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,560
but now, like it's only distributed between

107
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
like a thousand people as opposed to like,

108
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,000
you know, this country, 60 million people.

109
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,680
So I own everything.

110
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,000
And you're paying me,

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
you're paying me rent for your house,

112
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,280
you're paying me for the food that you eat.

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,200
You're paying me for the energy that you consume.

114
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,960
Every time you go

115
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
shopping, you're paying me to go to the shops,

116
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,680
every time you go to the pub. Because I own the pub.

117
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
I own the shop, I own, you know, I own the airport.

118
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,080
You know, I own the hospital. I own the school.

119
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
So every time, you're constantly

120
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,440
having to make this transfer payment to me.

121
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,880
That's the wealth unequal economy.

122
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,400
So what are the differences?

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,880
I mean, the first obvious difference

124
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,480
is in a wealth equal

125
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,160
economy, you've got a lot more financial security,

126
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,800
and you've got a decent passive income.

127
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,040
Obviously, if you

128
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,120
if you had a decent chunk of the country's wealth,

129
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,320
you could probably survive

130
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,240
without working for the same amount of time.

131
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
Firstly, because you've got this passive income,

132
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,120
you've got this stock portfolio.

133
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,840
Secondly, because you're not paying rent,

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,600
you're not paying a mortgage

135
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,760
because you own the property that you live in.

136
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,640
So you've got quite a lot of,

137
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,720
a lot of financial security.

138
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,640
You've got passive income.

139
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,200
If you want to stop working for a bit,

140
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
if you want to like, pursue your hobbies,

141
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
you can do that.

142
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,000
Whereas in the wealth unequal economy,

143
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,160
you, the ordinary person doesn't

144
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,480
have any financial security, right?

145
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,400
You don't have any savings

146
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,800
you can run down if you lose a job,

147
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,240
you know, you basically you're not paying the rent.

148
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
So you're much more financially

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,160
insecure.

150
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
The flip of that is

151
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,280
that the rich have this massive, massive passive income

152
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,000
that they've got every year,

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
every year, every month, every week, basically.

154
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,680
What we should point out is like the real world

155
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,760
is somewhere in between this.

156
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
So there are some countries

157
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,120
which are super, super, super unequal.

158
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,240
You know, if you go to sort of

159
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,160
some countries in, in Africa or Latin America or,

160
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,960
or India,

161
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,200
wealth is very, very unequal.

162
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,800
Ordinary people don't own much.

163
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,840
If they do own stuff, it's like sort of,

164
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,760
they usually have debt behind it.

165
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,200
But you know, this country we're in

166
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,480
now is it's like a middle point.

167
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
So I'm not saying that this country

168
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
is that super wealth unequal space.

169
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,360
We'll talk about that later

170
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,000
but the real world is somewhere in between.

171
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,240
Yeah.

172
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,040
So that's what you have in the unequal economy,

173
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,400
you have these two groups,

174
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,520
this very, very large group that has no real security.

175
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
They have to work in order to live.

176
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
They don't have much passive income.

177
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
And you have this very small group

178
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,840
that is extremely wealthy

179
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,680
and has this massive passive income.

180
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,480
And, you know,

181
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
depending on how much inequality you have,

182
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,480
those groups can vary in size basically.

183
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,240
So when you have this large wealth-less group,

184
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
they're insecure,

185
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,840
they don't have a lot of income.

186
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
So basically most of what they get

187
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,000
is going to get spent on essentials.

188
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,160
the flip side of that is

189
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,040
when you have a very,

190
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,520
very wealthy, wealthy group,

191
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,560
they’re small but their income is massive.

192
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,840
You need to understand

193
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,960
it's important to understand the economy,

194
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
the economics of inequality,

195
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,080
the way that very, very wealthy people spend,

196
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,840
which is basically that they

197
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,520
save almost everything they make.

198
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,840
And this is not because wealthy people are like crazy,

199
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,040
they're obsessed with saving.

200
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,720
It's just simply

201
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,600
because their passive income is so big.

202
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,680
So, you know, I often use example of Rishi Sunak.

203
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
His wealth,

204
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,840
according to the Sunday Times, is £700 million.

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
So he'll make like

206
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,320
like £1 million a week passive income.

207
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,680
So it's not that he's obsessed with saving,

208
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
but you know, if you have £1 million

209
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,400
a week, passive income it’s basically impossible to.

210
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,520
Maybe someone can manage it,

211
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,560
but your average person

212
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,240
is making £1 million a week passive income.

213
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,840
You know,

214
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,920
even to spend for me, even spend £10,000

215
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I can't even imagine

216
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
how you could spend £10,000 a week.

217
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,440
But because their income is so high,

218
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,760
they simply basically have no choice but to save

219
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,680
the money. So,

220
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,000
so in an unequal society, you have a big chunk,

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
a big chunk of people

222
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,640
on essentials,

223
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
small group of people, but with massive income,

224
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,520
just saving, saving, saving, saving, saving, saving.

225
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,920
Whereas in the wealth equal society,

226
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,880
because everyone is quite secure,

227
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,480
they will tend to live

228
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,360
what nowadays

229
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,840
we consider kind of middle class lives,

230
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,960
which is

231
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,160
they'll spend money, they'll go on holiday,

232
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,880
they'll go to restaurants, they go to bars.

233
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,200
You know, if they want to reskill or pursue a hobby,

234
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,480
they might take time out of work.

235
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,720
They might take time out of work

236
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,960
to take care of children

237
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,600
or to raise children or to travel

238
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,720
because they have this financial security,

239
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,040
they have these assets they can sell,

240
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,600
they have this passive income. So it's very different.

241
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,520
There's these kind of three types of spending profiles.

242
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,600
Right.

243
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,280
The poor spending profile, which is only essentials.

244
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,560
The rich spending profile,

245
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,240
which is almost exclusively saving, buying assets.

246
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
And the middle saving profile,

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
which is

248
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
like a relaxed sort of modern middle class lifestyle.

249
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
So the first big difference

250
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,000
you have between a more equal society

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,160
and an unequal society is that the unequal society

252
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,280
as a whole

253
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,120
cares less about spending and cares more about saving.

254
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,680
And that is

255
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,280
because if we consider only this,

256
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,000
the passive income that comes from ownership

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
in an equal society,

258
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,600
that's all going to middle class

259
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,360
people and middle class people,

260
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,440
they tend to spend most of what they get

261
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
over the course of their life.

262
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,520
If they get more money,

263
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,000
they'll tend to increase their spending.

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
Whatever, go on more holidays,

265
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,120
buy a bigger house, this kind of thing.

266
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,520
So if you're churning this passive income to middle

267
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,840
class people, it’s getting spent, it’s

268
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,960
getting spent, it’s getting spent.

269
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,640
If instead we take all of that income

270
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,600
and we give it to this tiny elite group,

271
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,920
of course they will spend a lot of money,

272
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,240
but we can see from the spending profiles

273
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,480
of the very rich.

274
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,400
You know, if you give £1,000 to a middle class person,

275
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
you'll probably spend £600.

276
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,040
You give £1,000 to Rishi Sunak, you’re

277
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,960
never going to notice right.

278
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,120
He's not going to change his spending at all.

279
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,320
So as we give more and more money to the very rich,

280
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
basically societal spending starts to fall.

281
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,520
They don’t want to spend money.

282
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,800
And what they're doing instead is,

283
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,680
well if we look at the behaviour

284
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,280
of the very, very rich is,

285
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
they’re just

286
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,000
saving, they're just saving,

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,120
they're just saving, they're just saving. Which,

288
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,240
you know, saving can mean a few different things.

289
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,880
It can mean investing.

290
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,440
Or it can also mean buying existing assets,

291
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
or it can be making loans.

292
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,880
So they’re buying assets, they’re lending money.

293
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,360
If there are good investments around,

294
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,720
they'll try to do investments as well.

295
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,160
So now I think we can consider

296
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,800
like what these two worlds look like.

297
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,200
When you consider these two things paired together.

298
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,360
Number one, in the wealth unequal world,

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,400
there's a lot of people

300
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,360
who are very financially insecure

301
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,280
because they don't have savings to fall back on.

302
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,880
They don't own their own house,

303
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,240
they don't own their own food or energy.

304
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
They don't have any passive income.

305
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,240
These people are very insecure,

306
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,520
and they live in a world

307
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,320
where all of the

308
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,160
spending power is held by a very small group of people

309
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,360
who don't spend a lot of money.

310
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,280
Do you want to check the cameras by the way?

311
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,360
You can go up and come back if you want?

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm just gonna trust it.

313
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Yeah.

314
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
So they live in this world where

315
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,680
they really, really, really need to work, but society

316
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,160
doesn't really want to spend that much

317
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,320
because the group of people with spending power

318
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,480
is quite small

319
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
and those people tend to save like 98% of their income.

320
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,800
So you can see straight away

321
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,960
they're in a bad situation, right?

322
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Because you have a world, loads of people need to work.

323
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,280
There's very few potential customers,

324
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,040
and those people don't actually spend much,

325
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,920
like as a proportion of their income.

326
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,320
Add on top of that,

327
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,080
these guys have a ton of wealth, right?

328
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,120
And that wealth includes in a high technology society,

329
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
it includes a lot of like labour saving stuff.

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,720
So these guys own factories, but high tech factories

331
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,280
don't actually need a lot of workers.

332
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,440
Increasingly, you know,

333
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,480
we're moving towards an AI world where, you know,

334
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,720
these guys, they've got really high tech factories

335
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,800
that don't need a lot of workers.

336
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,280
They'll have AI,

337
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,760
which means you need even fewer workers.

338
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,440
I think when you add these things together,

339
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,480
you can basically see

340
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,280
my conclusion, number one,

341
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,800
which is unequal economies have very low wages.

342
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,480
And that is because,

343
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,440
well, first thing I'll say is

344
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,800
I think if you look at the world,

345
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,560
you know, it's

346
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,160
not I'm not saying

347
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,480
this is the only factor that matters,

348
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
but I think if you look at the world,

349
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,920
you will see that very unequal economies

350
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,800
have low wages, whereas more middle class economies

351
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,000
like Western Europe,

352
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,680
like North America, like Japan,

353
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,120
like Australia, have higher wages.

354
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,480
But once you see this logic,

355
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,680
I think you can understand why, right?

356
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,920
Which is when you have a very unequal society,

357
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,520
you have a huge group of people

358
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,760
desperate to work for a tiny group of people

359
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,040
who don't spend much money and don't need any workers

360
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,320
because they've got all of this

361
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,600
productive capital, productive technology.

362
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,560
So that's number one.

363
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,960
Conclusion number one,

364
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,440
you can put it up there if you want.

365
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,800
Unequal economies have low wages. That's number one.

366
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,960
So the second thing is,

367
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,200
you know, the reason that wages are low

368
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,360
is because, okay

369
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,280
there's a lot of desperate workers,

370
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,920
but also because the money

371
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,400
is being controlled by people who don't want to spend,

372
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,040
what they're doing instead is saving.

373
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,080
So, you know, there's this kind of argument

374
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,040
and you get this sort of trickle down economics,

375
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,480
which is actually this is good

376
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,600
because you're giving the money to savers

377
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
and saving is good

378
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,840
because if we save then, we're going to invest

379
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,480
and we're going to grow.

380
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,600
The problem you get is

381
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,000
when there's not a lot of end consumption demand,

382
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,040
companies don't actually want to grow.

383
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,840
They don't want to invest

384
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,040
because there's not really a lot of customers.

385
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,120
And what companies want,

386
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,280
if they want to grow, is they want customers, right.

387
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,040
So what do rich people do

388
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,680
when they're in a world that they have all this

389
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
massive passive income, that they're not spending,

390
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,120
but there's not a lot of actual investment

391
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
opportunities around.

392
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,920
The answer is they buy assets.

393
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,640
They buy assets.

394
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,680
And they will try to buy assets from the middle class

395
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,160
if there is a middle class,

396
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,120
or they will try to buy assets

397
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,200
from each other basically. And what you have is

398
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,720
when you have this unequal economy,

399
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,280
you're giving all of the consumption power

400
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,640
to very, very rich people.

401
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,720
Very rich people, percentage wise,

402
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,840
have a very low demand to consume and a massive

403
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,400
demand to save.

404
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,520
Basically what these people want is assets.

405
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,280
So the second thing you will see

406
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,840
is increase in asset prices,

407
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
massive increase in asset prices.

408
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,040
Because you're giving all of the money

409
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,800
to people who are just trying to buy assets.

410
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,160
There's not a lot of investment opportunity.

411
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,680
So they’re buying assets,

412
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,760
they’re buying assets, they’re buying assets.

413
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,240
So I think this makes sense, right.

414
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,360
If you take the consumption power

415
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,440
away from ordinary people who spend,

416
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
you give it to rich people who save.

417
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,720
Wages will fall and asset prices will increase.

418
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,120
So these are for me,

419
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,120
these really are the two key features

420
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,280
of an unequal economy, low wages, high asset prices.

421
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
But you can probably see

422
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
instinctively that these two things

423
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
like interrelate in quite problematic way, right.

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
Because if wages are low and asset prices,

425
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,280
like including house prices, are high,

426
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,000
and this includes like other

427
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,720
like basic essentials of life, like,

428
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,040
you know, like the farms

429
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,080
which produce food or, you know, the power plants

430
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,200
which produce energy, these are assets as well.

431
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,560
These will be expensive.

432
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,480
What you have is a world

433
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,360
where ordinary people have no wages

434
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,680
and the things which they need

435
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,040
housing, food, energy are really expensive.

436
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,720
This is kind of like a

437
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,600
really bad combination basically. So

438
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
what you see there is

439
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,080
basically really high levels of financial insecurity

440
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,720
because not only are you desperate for work

441
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,120
and it's hard to get a job,

442
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,680
but the things

443
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,800
which you need, the basic essentials of life,

444
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,000
housing, food, energy,

445
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the assets that produce those things, including houses,

446
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
are super, super, super expensive.

447
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,520
So you have financial instability,

448
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,120
but also you have this...

449
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,640
It's becomes really, really difficult to climb up

450
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
because if you live in a world where wages are low,

451
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
housing is really expensive.

452
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,760
Even if you're able to get a higher than average wage,

453
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
it becomes

454
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
quite possible that you'll never be able

455
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,040
to afford a house, basically.

456
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,920
So there you have the next thing, which is

457
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,440
basically low social mobility, low social mobility.

458
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,040
And also increasingly work becomes

459
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,920
like less important in a weird way.

460
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
It is important in one way,

461
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,920
because if you don't work, you'll die

462
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
because you need to work to eat.

463
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,120
But work ceases to...

464
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,440
the idea that if I work hard

465
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,840
or if I study hard, I get a better job,

466
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,720
I get a house becomes less and less realistic

467
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,040
because wages are falling, house prices are rising.

468
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,480
You know,

469
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,280
even if you get two or 3 or 4 times the average wage,

470
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
it might be that

471
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,800
something like a house is out of reach.

472
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,920
So you get this kind of crystallisation

473
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,560
of the class system,

474
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,800
it becomes impossible to work your way up.

475
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
The next thing I want to talk about

476
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,200
is how this leads to a kind of concentration,

477
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,320
economic concentration in capitalism.

478
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,840
So we're talking about a concentration

479
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,680
of wealth, right.

480
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But this manifests in different ways, right.

481
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,200
So we have really once we concentrate wealth

482
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,120
we concentrate passive income.

483
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,600
We also concentrate spending power.

484
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,720
Suddenly then if I'm a business and I want to grow,

485
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,840
what am I going to do?

486
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,400
Well, I'm not going to produce stuff that you want

487
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,560
because you've got no f**king money, right?

488
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,360
You're saving up everything

489
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,520
you can just to buy a house.

490
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,040
You know you can't afford to go to the pub,

491
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,000
you can't afford to go the restaurants.

492
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
So your pub's going to close down.

493
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
The restaurants in your area are going to close down.

494
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,040
They're going to get turned into basic

495
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,040
like slum accommodation.

496
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm a business, what am I going to invest in?

497
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,280
What do the rich want?

498
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
Because they’ve got so much money,

499
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,560
so much money, more and more money.

500
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,280
It's growing, it's growing. What do the rich want?

501
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,640
So what you see is increasingly

502
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,120
this split in industry,

503
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,800
which is industry stops producing for the middle class.

504
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,920
It starts producing just like bare bones

505
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,680
essentials for the poor

506
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,920
and increasingly focuses on luxury industries.

507
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
So I think you're seeing this or you're seeing this...

508
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,840
I live in London, we're here in London now.

509
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,240
You see this in the...

510
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,200
you see this literally in the housing stock.

511
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,160
So I grew up,

512
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,720
where I grew up in Ilford in East London

513
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,080
it used to be...

514
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,760
It was a poor area when I grew up,

515
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,240
but it was like lower middle

516
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,440
class, upper working class families.

517
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,680
If you go there now, those small terraced houses,

518
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,560
they've been expanded out backwards, expanded up,

519
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,760
and they're running up by the room

520
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,320
to, you know, recent, very, very poor recent migrants.

521
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,200
And what that is, is,

522
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,080
you know, we're no longer

523
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
producing middle class housing

524
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
because there's no middle class.

525
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,160
This is the thing.

526
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
Inequality means no middle class.

527
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,520
So bare bones essentials.

528
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,920
But obviously now I live closer to central London.

529
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,360
If you live in and around central,

530
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,880
what people always complain is

531
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
there's only luxury housing being built.

532
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,760
And, you know, that’s an obvious consequence

533
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,520
of this wealth inequality, which is that

534
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,680
capitalism will adjust if the middle class has no money

535
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,000
and the rich have all the money.

536
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,680
We're going to stop producing middle class cars.

537
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,160
We’re going to stop producing middle class housing.

538
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,080
We’re going to try and transition that to the rich.

539
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,240
I’ve got a lot of friends who are dentists.

540
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,920
I've got friends who are doctors

541
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,960
and the ones who make the most money,

542
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,440
they don't fix teeth of middle class people,

543
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,040
they do plastic surgery

544
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,560
and cosmetic stuff for rich people.

545
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,440
And that's what you would do

546
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,640
because these guys have the money. So the next thing is

547
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,840
wealth inequality leads to industry concentration,

548
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,800
industry concentration.

549
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,680
Businesses no longer really produced for the middle.

550
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,880
They produce for the...

551
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,520
basics for the poor and luxuries for the rich.

552
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,800
But it's also geographic concentration, right?

553
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,880
So when we we go back and we talk again about

554
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,760
the relatively equal society

555
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,200
in a relatively equal society, everyone was an owner,

556
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
everyone was a worker,

557
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,760
and everyone was a consumer.

558
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,000
And, this is nice, right?

559
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,080
Because workers need consumers

560
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
and consumers need workers, right.

561
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,560
Like, if you want to work,

562
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,920
you need somebody who’s going to, you know...

563
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,000
You’re a cameraman, nobody's making videos, you’ve

564
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,680
got no work, right?

565
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,320
I'm making videos, I need a cameraman.

566
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,360
It works together, right.

567
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,760
These two things come together. But

568
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,920
once you move to that

569
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,840
wealth unequal society, you split.

570
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,800
You have a big group of workers,

571
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
but they don't really spend much.

572
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,120
They're not really consuming.

573
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,560
And you have this small group of consumers, they’ve

574
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,760
got a lot of money, but there's not a lot of them.

575
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,040
And they don't need to work, basically.

576
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,760
This causes geographic problems, right?

577
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,120
Because if everyone is a worker

578
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
and everyone is a consumer,

579
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,960
then whenever you have a city,

580
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,280
you've got workers and consumers.

581
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,840
This is like, it works really well, right?

582
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,480
Because the workers need

583
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,920
consumers, consumers need workers,

584
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
every worker is a consumer.

585
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,800
So basically cities work economically

586
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,680
because wherever there's people, there's people.

587
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
Wherever there's workers, there’s

588
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,960
consumers, wherever there’s consumers, there's workers.

589
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,520
But once you have this unequal economy,

590
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,920
then the workers are not consumers,

591
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
and the consumers are not workers.

592
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,200
So what that means is

593
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,120
if you cannot attract rich people to your city,

594
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
there's no consumers in your city.

595
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,680
And these guys own your city, right?

596
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,720
They own the housing, they own the food.

597
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,320
You need food.

598
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,640
You need energy, right? Well, these guys got the food.

599
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
They got the energy.

600
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,640
What are you offering? You need to offer something.

601
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,160
So if you live in,

602
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,680
you know,

603
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,520
we talk about parts of the North which historically

604
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,800
were big centres of industry.

605
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,960
You know,

606
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,720
I could keep listing lots and lots of places,

607
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,360
you know, places like Newcastle, places

608
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,560
like Glasgow, places like Wigan.

609
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,880
Nothing wrong with these places, but,

610
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,920
you know, places that these...

611
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,560
people have been living there for hundreds of years.

612
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,040
And they used to be like centres of industry.

613
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
They're struggling now

614
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,600
because there’s no rich people there.

615
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,720
And then you have workers without consumers.

616
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,080
And if you have workers without consumers,

617
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,840
then there's no jobs.

618
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,040
So what do those consumers have to do?

619
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,880
They have to go to where the rich people are.

620
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,560
And, you know, we've spoken about this in other videos.

621
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,360
I think there's a bit of a misconception

622
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,560
in modern economics

623
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,520
that what we're having is a big city, small city split.

624
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,400
But it's actually not

625
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,800
that it's a rich city, poor city split.

626
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,840
You know I studied in Oxford for two years, it’s

627
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,360
not a big city, very expensive.

628
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,400
You know, places like Glasgow, places that Newcastle

629
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,080
much bigger, much, much cheaper.

630
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,480
Cambridge is also expensive.

631
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
You know, if you go to the places

632
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,000
where rich people go on

633
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,160
holiday, phenomenally expensive, you know.

634
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,960
Any popular holiday destination

635
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,800
for the rich is unbelievably expensive.

636
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
If you go to the place where they study, like Oxford,

637
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,280
you know, it's very, very expensive.

638
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,160
So basically,

639
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,040
geographically the poor people have to move.

640
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,880
You have to move,

641
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,520
you have to go to where the rich people are.

642
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,720
But the problem you have is

643
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,480
when you have a very unequal economy, you know, if it's

644
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,720
90% : 10%.

645
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,560
Well there’s 9 poor people for every rich people.

646
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,600
If it’s 99 : 1, it’s

647
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,440
99 poor people for every rich person, right.

648
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,720
And also, you know, rich people,

649
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,240
they kind of, they tend to like the same things.

650
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,680
They tend to want to live in the same places.

651
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,000
They tend to want to study in the same places.

652
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,440
They tend to go on holiday in the same places.

653
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,920
They're kind of like a community, right?

654
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,360
You know, rich people,

655
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,320
they don't spend a lot of time in Wigan,

656
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,160
you know, they don't spend a lot of time in Newcastle.

657
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,760
They don't spend a lot of time in Glasgow.

658
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,160
They don't spend a lot of time in Blackpool.

659
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
You know, they don't spend...

660
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,840
they just don't spend time in these places.

661
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,600
And then you’ve got to leave because economically

662
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,080
people, most people are now workers but not consumer.

663
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,920
So you’ve got to move.

664
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,440
So then you get these big floods,

665
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,120
you get these big floods of people

666
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,800
from

667
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,120
the north of England to places like the south east.

668
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,800
But you know, it's not at all UK specific.

669
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,000
You know,

670
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,240
you see

671
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
really, really similar things happening in the US

672
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,120
where places like the Rust Belt, people are leaving,

673
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,800
they're being moved. They have to move to the coasts.

674
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,040
You see southern Europe, these things are happening.

675
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,560
Spain and Italy, people are leaving.

676
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,440
People are going to like

677
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,280
the industrial cities of Germany, even the UK.

678
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,600
China, same thing is happening.

679
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,680
Same thing’s happening in China,

680
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,000
same thing is happening in India.

681
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,280
These historical places

682
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,400
where people have lived for hundreds

683
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,080
or even thousands of years,

684
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,520
they don't work in a very unequal society anymore.

685
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,960
So people have to leave. People have to leave.

686
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,560
The problem you have then is

687
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,040
they have to go to where the rich people are.

688
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,080
There's not a lot of rich people.

689
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,680
So those places become very overcrowded.

690
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,840
So you get this flood of people and then you kind of,

691
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,120
you then create a sort of

692
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,920
a two world world

693
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,200
where there's either places

694
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,920
where there's no rich people

695
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,840
and no jobs, or places where there are rich people,

696
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,720
poor people having to flood there.

697
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,160
They become extremely dense, extremely overcrowded,

698
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,080
sometimes dirty, sometimes polluted,

699
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,720
but most obviously because everyone has to live there

700
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,440
really, really expensive,

701
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,840
most obviously really, really expensive,

702
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,440
really, really expensive rents.

703
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,560
So you force these people who

704
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,160
really, really need work, can't get work,

705
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,560
can't afford a house

706
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,360
to live in cities with rich people

707
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,800
where rents are expensive

708
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,040
and they can't afford to rent. So it's

709
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,360
kind of disaster on disaster on disaster, isn't it?

710
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,560
And this is the kind of

711
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,680
set of mechanics

712
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,720
which I sort of started to recognise

713
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,440
when I was a trader.

714
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,160
The next video, I'm going to talk about,

715
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,560
why economists never talk about this.

716
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,240
Because I didn't learn these ideas from university.

717
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,080
So for people who don't know, I did an undergrad

718
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,240
at London School of Economics, three years,

719
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,280
I did a masters at Oxford for two years.

720
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
So I’ve studied economics

721
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,840
at universities for a long time,

722
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,320
these ideas where never taught to me at university.

723
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
I learned these as a trader.

724
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,960
We're going to cover that in the next video.

725
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,280
But before I finish this video,

726
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,960
I just want to add one other thing,

727
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,280
which is going back to transfer payments

728
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,840
in the equal society.

729
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
They go around, they go around like in a circle.

730
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,040
In the unequal society, transfer payments go one way.

731
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,240
The people who don't own assets are paying money

732
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,720
to people who own assets.

733
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,040
The people

734
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,720
who have the assets

735
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,400
then use that money to buy the rest of the assets

736
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,360
Which means next year,

737
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,480
the people who don't own assets have to pay more.

738
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,360
Once you understand this, you can see that

739
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,080
there's a worryingly accelerating nature to inequality.

740
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,640
Which is the bigger inequality is, the higher

741
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,800
the amount of transfer payments

742
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,120
made from the poor to the rich,

743
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,400
which means the higher

744
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,960
the rate at which the rich dispossessed the poor,

745
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
which means the higher the rate of transfer payments.

746
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,080
So this is, and probably the thing

747
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,280
which sort of caught me the most

748
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,360
and worried me the most about this.

749
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,680
Mathematically, this is not self containing.

750
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,560
This is the thing

751
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
that spirals out of control once it becomes...

752
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,920
and I think this is why,

753
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,400
if you looked throughout history, you'll see that

754
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,000
in most of history inequality is very high.

755
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:12,800
Okay.

756
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,320
So that's it.

757
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,240
Quite a big one, second video on the course.

758
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,800
But I think it's really important.

759
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,840
Because it was quite long,

760
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,480
I'll quickly run down the main points, which is,

761
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,320
when inequality is very high,

762
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,560
there's a high level of financial insecurity.

763
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
There's a high level of transfer

764
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,080
payments from the both the rich.

765
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,760
There's not a lot of spending,

766
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,400
a lot of poor people trying to work

767
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,560
for a small amount of rich people

768
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,720
who have productive capital and don't need workers.

769
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,920
Wages are low. Number one, wages are low.

770
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,880
The rich have enormous amount

771
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,640
of passive income, way more than they can spend.

772
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,520
They want to invest it,

773
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,400
but there's no investment

774
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
because there's not a lot of spending.

775
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,960
They're trying to buy assets, asset prices are high.

776
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,480
Wages are low, one.

777
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Asset prices are high, two.

778
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,800
Industries tend to concentrate

779
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,520
in whatever the rich people want.

780
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,600
But people are also forced to concentrate on whatever

781
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,800
the rich people want.

782
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,760
So poor people are forced to flood to the cities.

783
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
Places where the rich

784
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,880
are not living, become very economically deprived.

785
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,120
Places where the rich are living

786
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,840
become extremely expensive.

787
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,400
Rents become high,

788
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,480
and because the poor paying lots of money to the rich,

789
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
inequality tends to increase

790
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,320
and the situation tends to get worst year after year.

791
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,040
Okay, that's number two.

792
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,600
This is one of the more

793
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,840
depressing videos on the channel.

794
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,480
I suppose, but it's really important to understand it.

795
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,920
And you know,

796
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,280
I made a lot of money betting on these things.

797
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,320
I think it's what's happening,

798
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,840
it’s helped me to make the really good predictions

799
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,560
we've made on the channel.

800
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,280
Next video will cover why

801
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,120
economists never talk about it if it's so important.

802
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,960
And we'll keep building up more and more videos

803
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,360
to build a really comprehensive course

804
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,520
of how inequality affects the economy.

805
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,040
And that’s it, video done.
