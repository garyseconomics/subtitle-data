1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,440
Okay.

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,320
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,000
This week

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,720
I want to do something a little bit different,

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,800
which is to talk about

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,720
a discussion

7
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,120
which has been causing a lot of disagreements

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,320
here in Garys Economics offices, which is,

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,240
largely this kitchen and a WhatsApp group.

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,680
Recently we got contacted

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
by the Labour Party, basically,

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,360
which is the first time

13
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,800
we've ever been contacted by the Labour Party.

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
And, they said,

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,560
you know, we've been seeing

16
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,840
what you've been doing on the channel

17
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,080
and we would like to send some MPs

18
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,080
onto the channel to talk to you about,

19
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,640
presumably the economy.

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,360
And my initial instinct

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,840
when that happens was that

22
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,800
we have to let them on basically,

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,600
that was a kind of a,

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,160
I think, a moral like a, like an ethical response

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
because we criticise the government a lot.

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,080
Labour have been in government

27
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,080
for coming up to a year now.

28
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,720
We've criticised them a lot, before them

29
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,680
we criticised the Conservatives a lot.

30
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,400
But I felt that since we are criticising

31
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,960
these guys

32
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,000
a lot on the channel,

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,840
we kind of have kind of an obligation

34
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,200
to let them come on and defend themselves.

35
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,720
They are literally the party of government

36
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,400
in this country.

37
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,520
I think I might even have said on the channel,

38
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
you know, if you want to come on,

39
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,640
we'll have you on,

40
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,520
so I felt like we kind of

41
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,440
have to have them on, really, from a moral perspective.

42
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
So I chucked it out there to the team,

43
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,000
we have like a very small team now

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,240
we have Jack, here the videographer,

45
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,280
and we have Oscar, who's the channel manager.

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,440
And I said, these guys want to come on the channel,

47
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,480
I think we have to have them on.

48
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
And we had a little chat about it.

49
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,760
And basically, Oscar thinks we shouldn't have them on.

50
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,000
I think Jack probably thinks we shouldn't

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,920
have them either.

52
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,680
So I wanted to basically talk about

53
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,960
what's going on in my head,

54
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,840
what's going on in our discussions

55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
about whether we should have them on.

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,240
And basically,

57
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
I wanted to put it to you guys,

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,000
the viewers, to basically let you guys

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,880
have your say about

60
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
whether you think we should have them on.

61
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,560
And I wanted to engage you guys in the thought process.

62
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,800
Yeah and just

63
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,480
encourage you to put in the comments what you think.

64
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,640
So I'm going to kind of go through the pros

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
and the cons as I see them.

66
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,680
So firstly

67
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,920
the pros, I think it's kind of the right thing to do,

68
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,520
to have them on

69
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
because as I say, we've been criticising them

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
and they're the party of government

71
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,160
and we kind of

72
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,280
should give them like a right

73
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,400
to reply to defend themselves.

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
Other pros,

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,760
look, I'll be clear about what I'm doing here.

76
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,200
You know, this is obviously a YouTube channel,

77
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,080
but those of you who've been watching for a long time,

78
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
you will probably be aware that,

79
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,360
you know, I'm not just doing this

80
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,600
YouTube channel to make videos.

81
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,360
I want to achieve political change here.

82
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
You know, I want to achieve a fairer tax system

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
which taxes

84
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
the very rich more and taxes ordinary working

85
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,880
people less.

86
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,600
I want to stop increasing inequality.

87
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,800
I want to try to stop falling living standards.

88
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,440
You know, and everything, the writing of the book,

89
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,280
it's all about trying to achieve political change.

90
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,040
And i’ll be very clear, like plan A for me,

91
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,080
and I think I've said this on the channel before,

92
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,600
is to try to influence the Labour Party

93
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,040
running up into the next election.

94
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,760
I think that they will fail on the economy.

95
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,440
I think that living standards will continue to decline.

96
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,120
I think that Labour and Keir

97
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,080
Starmer will become increasingly unpopular

98
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,920
because of that,

99
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,920
and I think they will be forced to,

100
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,440
if not replace Keir Starmer, at the very least

101
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,600
do a significant rebrand on economic policy.

102
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,840
And I think they will be forced

103
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,880
to consider a new direction

104
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,240
to consider, at the very least,

105
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
a new style of messaging.

106
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,880
But I think they will be forced to listen to new ideas.

107
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,040
And, I think that

108
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,520
if we can keep growing the channel at the kind of pace

109
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,280
we have been growing the channel,

110
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
I think that we

111
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
can be big enough

112
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,880
and can be powerful enough that we maybe can influence

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,240
that changing

114
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,680
economic direction for the party,

115
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,080
which will probably come in two years

116
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,680
time, three years time leading into the election.

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
That might sound crazy,

118
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,160
but the growth of the channel

119
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,960
is so quick at the moment,

120
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
and the growth in support is so quick,

121
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
I actually think that that is achievable.

122
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,200
But that obviously means

123
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,160
building some form of connection

124
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,280
with Labour and some form of influence in Labour.

125
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,680
I'll be clear about that.

126
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm not trying to sort of

127
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,920
covertly become a member of the Labour Party.

128
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
My priority,

129
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,040
my plan is to make this channel so big

130
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,800
that they basically have to talk to us,

131
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,840
whether they like us or not.

132
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,240
I call this the Rupert Murdoch plan.

133
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,080
So Rupert Murdoch,

134
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,400
for those who don't know who he is, is

135
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,920
one of the richest men in the world.

136
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,240
He's an Australian media businessman.

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,720
He owns loads of newspapers.

138
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,200
And really,

139
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
he kind of indirectly controls

140
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,640
politics in a lot of countries, including the UK,

141
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,280
because he has so much influence

142
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,240
over the public through his newspapers

143
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
and his TV channels

144
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,560
that unless prime ministers get his support,

145
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
they basically can't win elections.

146
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,120
And I think I'm not wrong in saying,

147
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,080
wasn't he godson to Tony Blair's kid?

148
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,720
I think he...

149
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,640
double check me on that.

150
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840
But,

151
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,040
you know,

152
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,920
I think one of the reasons Tony Blair was so successful

153
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,960
politically is because he got Rupert

154
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,040
Murdoch's support, basically.

155
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,880
And I think Rupert Murdoch is a great example

156
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,720
of how you don't need to be an MP or even prime

157
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,120
minister directly to completely control

158
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,080
politics, basically.

159
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
He is, he was? Yeah, yeah so I'm not wrong on this.

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
-Tony Blair Godfather to Rupert Murdock’s daughter.

161
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,600
Okay.

162
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,200
Tony Blair Godfather to Rupert Murdock’s daughter.

163
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,840
Okay, so they were close basically.

164
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,680
I think Rupert Murdoch shows you that

165
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,720
if you have a big enough media presence,

166
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,840
you can basically boss the political parties around.

167
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,160
And that's my plan A, basically.

168
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,280
The growth on this channel

169
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,640
is unbelievably quick at the moment.

170
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
I don't know whether we'll be able

171
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,840
to keep up that level of speed,

172
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,760
but to be honest, you know,

173
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,520
we're going to try to get some big media hits.

174
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,120
You know,

175
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,640
Diary of a CEO, Question Time, The Rest Is Politics.

176
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,280
Maybe we can keep growing at this pace.

177
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
And if we do

178
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,480
yeah then Labour will have to listen to us.

179
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,840
But either way if I don't want to set up

180
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,480
a political party myself,

181
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,200
which, trust me, I don't,

182
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,960
I think our best chance of influencing policy is

183
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
via the Labour Party. So,

184
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,360
obviously having them on is

185
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,960
a way to try to develop some sort of relationship.

186
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,240
Which I guess brings us onto the negatives,

187
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,960
because one of the obvious negatives is,

188
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,040
I am very, very critical of Labour

189
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,880
Party policy at the moment.

190
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,040
I think it will fail economically.

191
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,480
And if somebody comes on, I will say that.

192
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,840
And, you know, I'm not going to have them on

193
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,520
and be a soft touch, like I'm going to try to...

194
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
I'm going to tell them

195
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
that I think their policy will fail,

196
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
and I'm going to try to...

197
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,360
if they,

198
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,720
if they're unwilling to listen to that,

199
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,160
then I'll probably have to go for them

200
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,040
quite aggressively.

201
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,200
And there is a risk that we perhaps

202
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,760
sour the relationship with the Labour Party,

203
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,600
which might be problematic down the line. I don't know.

204
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,560
I want to be clear, I keep saying that,

205
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,320
I don't have a background in politics.

206
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,800
My background is in economics,

207
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,560
and I'm not a professional lobbyer.

208
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,560
I really don't know how this works.

209
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,600
My plan for a long time

210
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,160
has been to build

211
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,400
popularity with the public,

212
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
and it's only really

213
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,160
now the channel is growing

214
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,080
that I'm even starting to think about, okay,

215
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,560
how are we going to be able to leverage

216
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,200
this into political power down the line?

217
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,760
But yeah, that's one of the risks.

218
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
Number one is, you know,

219
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,440
we might potentially sour relations

220
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,320
with the Labour Party,

221
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,640
which might possibly influence

222
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,320
our ability to influence them,

223
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,040
affect our ability to implement them down the line,

224
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,480
which could be a problem.

225
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,880
To be honest,

226
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,560
I think if we get this channel big enough,

227
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
I don't think that'll be a problem,

228
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
because I think if we're big enough,

229
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
they have to listen.

230
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,040
But, you know,

231
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,320
maybe it is,

232
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,240
maybe you guys know more than me

233
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
about the Labour Party,

234
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
I'm not an expert, I'm not a member.

235
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
The second thing is,

236
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,160
it risks people

237
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,080
questioning the political neutrality of me

238
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,000
and the channel.

239
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,280
So I come into this as an economist.

240
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I consider what I'm doing

241
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
kind of a single issue campaign.

242
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,880
We need to stop wealth inequality increasing,

243
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,040
that's how we stop poverty from exploding.

244
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
I honestly don't consider myself

245
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
to be particularly politically factional.

246
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,760
I voted for a number of different political parties

247
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,640
over the course of my life.

248
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,240
But obviously,

249
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,960
if we let the Labour Party

250
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,280
on, there might be people that say,

251
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,240
“Oh, Gary's let the Labour Party on, he's

252
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
a Labour Party stooge.

253
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,240
He's on the left.” I think we have to accept we live in

254
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,560
increasingly, extremely

255
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
factional times with regard

256
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,560
to politics,

257
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,240
where people who feel that

258
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,200
they're on the right often

259
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,760
hate people who are on the left,

260
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,240
people who feel that they're on the left,

261
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,280
often hate people who are on the right.

262
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,240
And

263
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
I

264
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,280
I want to appeal to people

265
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,360
in both camps on either camp.

266
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,520
I honestly believe that

267
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
we're not politically factional,

268
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,560
and I want to be able

269
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,120
to remain believably politically non factional.

270
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,960
And that might be a risk if we have Labour on.

271
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,040
I would be bringing Labour on

272
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,440
because they are literally the party in government and

273
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,880
I criticise them a lot.

274
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
And I would have had the Conservatives

275
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
on when they were in government and,

276
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,240
you know,

277
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,080
I'd be open to having the Conservatives on

278
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
now if we had Labour on, but that's a risk

279
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
we might be seen as nonpolitical, factional,

280
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,520
we might be seen as, yeah, not politically neutral.

281
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,160
Then after that,

282
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,800
if we have Labour on in order to,

283
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,360
you know, defend and justify

284
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,920
that we are politically neutral, which I think that

285
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,360
we are,

286
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,840
we might need to have

287
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,200
the Conservatives on, we might need to have Reform on.

288
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
And some people might say

289
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
we should even have the Liberal Democrats on,

290
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,760
and we should even have the Greens on,

291
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,920
and we should the SNP on.

292
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,200
And then it starts to become a situation

293
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,520
where we are giving up

294
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,040
a significant amount of our time

295
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,280
to basically other people when, primarily this is a...

296
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,880
I want this channel to be

297
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,440
an educational channel, an informative channel.

298
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
I work hard to put out

299
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,760
informative educational videos

300
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,120
every week that help ordinary people understand

301
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,040
what is happening.

302
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,080
And we only do one video a week.

303
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
It takes up a lot of my time.

304
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,800
It takes up a lot of my energy.

305
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,520
It takes up a lot of our resources.

306
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,480
We don't really want to start

307
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
giving up a huge amount of basically this space

308
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
we've created to a bunch of politicians

309
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
who we don't really trust or even really

310
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,760
like necessarily.

311
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,600
So that's the second question.

312
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,080
Is it going to sort of

313
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,360
start us on a slippery slope

314
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
of having to give a lot of our time and space,

315
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
which we've worked hard to create, to people

316
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,320
that we don't really like,

317
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
people that we don't support.

318
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,360
And I don't mean that just Reform

319
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,720
and Conservatives, I include Labour in that,

320
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
because there are a lot of people in Labour

321
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
that maybe I'm not a massive fan of.

322
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,680
And then the next problem, potential problem

323
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,600
after this is quite simply

324
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,840
that it might just be really boring, it’s

325
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,360
I think a very real risks.

326
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,840
So, I mentioned message

327
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,720
discipline in my video last week.

328
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,800
One of the reasons why MPs are often quite boring

329
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,560
when they go on TV

330
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,360
is because they get told what to say by the party.

331
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,160
That's the way that it works,

332
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,640
party tells them what to say,

333
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
they don't have a huge amount of freedom.

334
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,800
And there's a very real risk

335
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,760
that we allow someone on the channel,

336
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,440
he sits here with me at the kitchen table.

337
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,880
He or she obviously, could be a woman.

338
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
And it's just really, really boring.

339
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,240
And it's just talking,

340
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
just speaking the talking points

341
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
they've been told to say.

342
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
They're not really thinking about the economy,

343
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
they're not really listening.

344
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,800
And it could just be really rubbish

345
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,240
TV, could just be really rubbish video.

346
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,400
That is a risk.

347
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,040
And I take pride in putting out good,

348
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,880
interesting videos on the channel.

349
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,000
People have their opinions on

350
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
whether they're good or interesting,

351
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,080
I think we produce good content.

352
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,520
And I've always believed that

353
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
it's really important to produce

354
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,200
good, interesting content,

355
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,240
and that is a risk

356
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
when we bring them on that it’s just boring,

357
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,680
boring content.

358
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
And then

359
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,800
to, you know,

360
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
then we're forced to bring on Reform and Conservatives,

361
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
and we just get a string of boring videos

362
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,320
and we become Garys Economics, political...

363
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,520
boring political broadcasts,

364
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,160
which is obviously not what we want to be.

365
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,720
And the next risk is just,

366
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:39,960
you know,

367
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,600
I am obviously not a professional interviewer.

368
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm an economist.

369
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,920
We've done interviews on the channel, we've only had...

370
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,880
we've only ever had three guests

371
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,920
on the channel, Matt Zarb-Cousin,

372
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,040
Stephanie Brobbey, and Jimmy the Giant,

373
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,840
all three people that I really like,

374
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,920
I really respect, I really respect their work.

375
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,400
But even so, you know,

376
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
people sometimes criticise

377
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
those videos and say, “Oh, Gary,

378
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,960
you're not a good interviewer.

379
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,840
You need to give the guest on to speak.”

380
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,720
And I think they're probably right.

381
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
I'm not a professional interviewer. It's not my job.

382
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,880
I would have to sort of sit

383
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,800
and think quite long and hard about,

384
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,440
you know, what do I would ask these people?

385
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
How do I want to run it?

386
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,200
How are we going to manage it if they're boring

387
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,000
and they don't say anything?

388
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
So it's just a lot of stuff for me to think about.

389
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,400
You know,

390
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,600
if I go too soft on them, people might say, “Oh, Gary,

391
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,640
you secretly support Labour.”

392
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,840
If I go too hard on them, people might say, “Oh, Gary,

393
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
you hate Labour.

394
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,880
You're on the right.” We might sour our abilities to

395
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,200
influence them down the line.

396
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
So yeah, that's basically it really.

397
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,720
We're throwing around a lot of ideas.

398
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,640
I think if I was thinking

399
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,040
purely explicitly about

400
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
like what is best for the YouTube channel,

401
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
probably I wouldn't have them on.

402
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,400
I think we, I think we've got a cool channel here.

403
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,560
I think we make great videos.

404
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,600
I think we make

405
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,320
we make fun, exciting,

406
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
accessible, educational, informative videos.

407
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,360
People like it.

408
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,560
We're growing really quickly, we're popular.

409
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,000
Everybody hates Labour,

410
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,720
I think they’re going to do quite a bad job.

411
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,960
Their brand is weak.

412
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,440
It's kind of toxic.

413
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
It's like, purely

414
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
from a growing the channel perspective,

415
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,200
it seems like an unnecessary risk.

416
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,960
But at the same time,

417
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,720
I think

418
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,800
and I'm kind of a lone voice in this in our team,

419
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,520
I think it's the right thing to do.

420
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,440
We attack them, we criticise them.

421
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,480
I think it’s the right thing to do.

422
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,960
These guys are literally

423
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,560
the government of this country.

424
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,040
Even if we don't have other parties on.

425
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
I think we have a

426
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,040
kind of a duty

427
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
to let them come on and defend themselves.

428
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
But no decision has been made.

429
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,440
I'm crazy, crazy busy,

430
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,240
and I haven't had a real chance to sit

431
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,880
and think it through.

432
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
So I thought we’d

433
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,640
try something different,

434
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,800
which is to just discuss here on camera

435
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,520
in front of you guys

436
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,280
what we're thinking,

437
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,720
what I'm thinking, and ask

438
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
you guys for your opinions, basically.

439
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,360
So, what do you think?

440
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,760
Should we have them on? What are the risks?

441
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
If we have them on, does that mean

442
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,520
we have to have on the Conservatives,

443
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,400
and Reform, the Liberal Democrats? What do you think?

444
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,640
Or is it a waste of our time

445
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,480
and we should just keep making the videos?

446
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,160
Of course, you know,

447
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,840
I can go back to these guys and say, hey, look,

448
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
I want to talk to you.

449
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
And I can sort of ask for, look,

450
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,280
if you want to come on the channel,

451
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,880
I need you to come and talk to me about...

452
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,080
are you going to give me what I want?

453
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,120
Are you going to be open to things like

454
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,360
wealth taxes, like a fairer tax system,

455
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,120
like raising tax on wealth and lowering tax on work?

456
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
So, you know, that is another option.

457
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,400
We can turn around and say,

458
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,360
“Yeah, we'll have you on the channel,

459
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,080
if you give us what we want, which is,

460
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,080
you know, a little bit more access to your policymakers

461
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,560
telling us how you make your policy.”

462
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,640
Lots of options here.

463
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,400
I have no background in political lobbying.

464
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm not really comfortable in this space.

465
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,920
I'm an economist at the end of the day, so be nice.

466
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,440
No decisions have been made,

467
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
but let us know what you think.

468
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,760
Yeah, put it in the comments.

469
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,520
We'll be watching, we'll be reading.

470
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,240
And that's all.

471
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,040
Well, I should say

472
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,520
the reason that we're

473
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,320
getting these kind of approaches from Labour

474
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,520
is because the channel is growing

475
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,480
unbelievably quickly, and that is

476
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
thanks to you, the viewers.

477
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,760
So I'd like to thank everyone

478
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,800
who watches the channel, shares

479
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
the channel, everybody who has bought the book

480
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,080
shared, the book.

481
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,680
The book at the time I'm speaking, the book’s

482
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,080
been five weeks at number one.

483
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,000
This is one of the reasons why we get these approaches.

484
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,640
Yeah, this is something that shows we are

485
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,400
getting a bit of political power,

486
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,200
and if we keep growing, we could get more,

487
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,840
but we haven't yet decided what the best way

488
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,160
is to play it, to approach it.

489
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,240
So let us know your opinions, put them in the comments.

490
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,960
Thanks for your support and keep watching. Thank you.
