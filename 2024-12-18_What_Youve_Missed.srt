00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,680
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,360
Today

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,920
we are going to cover everything

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,440
you've missed on the economy.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:08,800
Okay.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,960
So to do this video,

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,760
I went back and had a look at my video from last year,

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,240
bringing you up to speed with the economy.

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,880
And

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,760
that video last year,

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,520
I was saying that inflation

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,320
would come back to pretty much target.

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,040
Interest rates would start to fall.

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,600
We would see an enormous increase in stock prices,

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
an enormous increase in the gold price,

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
and we would see house prices start to go

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,360
as interest rates started to fall.

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,560
But despite all of that,

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,080
we would continue to see living standards and poverty

20
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,560
continue to decline.

21
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,120
And this is basically everything we've

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,240
seen in the last year.

23
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,280
I also said that Labour would win the election,

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,800
probably by a decent margin, because the Conservatives

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,440
were failing on the economy and were super unpopular,

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,960
but that Labour would very quickly become unpopular

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,440
on coming into power.

28
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,800
So if you've been keeping up to speed of what

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
we've been doing,

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,440
you won't be p***ed off that I was away for six months

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,480
because you already knew

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
exactly what was going to happen.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,200
So what are we going to cover now?

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,800
Okay, so this year we're going to cover

35
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,040
a few of the things which happened while I was away,

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,400
which I've not been able to talk about yet.

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,040
And their economic impact.

38
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,680
In particular, Labour’s

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
budget in the autumn and the Trump election.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,800
We're going to talk about how this year

41
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,680
and the coming year will be different from last year.

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,480
We're going to talk about,

43
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
a little bit

44
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,360
about what's going to happen in the economy

45
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,600
and what's going to happen in financial markets.

46
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,880
So I want to start with how this year is different

47
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,160
from last year,

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,960
because when I went and watched last year video,

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,360
I was quite struck by basically how much was the same.

50
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,040
So I had to look at financial markets

51
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,240
before I shot this video and basically

52
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,840
everything is at an all time high.

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,680
Most major stock markets are at or near

54
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,160
their all time highs in terms of price.

55
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,200
The gold price is at or near its all time high.

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,320
House prices are shooting up to new all time highs.

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,520
We're starting to see them start to really go.

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,600
And, it's kind of deja vu all over again.

59
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,760
So it's quite shocking, I think.

60
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,480
I think that really underlines

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,960
basically how aggressive these increases in asset

62
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
prices have been.

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
And I think it's important to talk about that

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,840
because I think what we see on the news

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,600
and what most of us understand about the economy,

66
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,400
is that living standards

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,760
have really failed to recover,

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,240
and they continue to slide,

69
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,840
and that gives the impression of a very weak economy.

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,440
And I do think we have a very weak economy.

71
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,120
But what is often not spoken about

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,640
is this fact that if you're looking at the economy

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,160
from the perspective of the asset holders,

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
which is basically from the perspective of the rich,

75
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,200
things are really, really, really, really good.

76
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Everything is at massive all time highs.

77
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,400
So you're going to see the rich people

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,480
seeing continued increase in their wealth.

79
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,880
They're basically doing the best they've ever done.

80
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,560
And I think this basically kind of underlines

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:02,880
the point

82
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,400
which I've been making for a long time,

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,000
which is this is not an economic crisis for everyone.

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,040
This is an economic crisis for you.

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
While the rich do really...

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,280
While the rich do really well,

87
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,960
which I think kind of underlines

88
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,240
that this is a crisis of inequality.

89
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,640
But I think what is probably most interesting

90
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,040
that is

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,040
different about the economy now compared to last year,

92
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,160
is I did my video last year,

93
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,160
inflation was still just above 4% in this country,

94
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,120
and there was still this kind of perception

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,280
that we were living in a very weak economy

96
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,480
because we were still in the kind of economic

97
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,880
aftermath of Covid,

98
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,000
and there was still this kind of perception

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,880
that, well,

100
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,080
we're screwed at the moment

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,600
because Covid was really bad

102
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,880
because of the Russia-Ukraine war,

103
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,760
but we're going to come through

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
that and things to be better.

105
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
And yet here we are

106
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,600
a year later and we’ve started to see

107
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,960
pretty much everything normalise.

108
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,560
Inflation is pretty much back down to around target

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,240
in most countries.

110
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,480
Commodity prices,

111
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,760
which went up in the war in Ukraine,

112
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,880
most of those are back down to the same levels

113
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,600
they were before the war in Ukraine.

114
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,360
Interest rates are starting to come back down again.

115
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
Unemployment is at normal levels.

116
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,040
GDP is back higher than it was before Covid.

117
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,520
And yet,

118
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,760
despite the fact that everything

119
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,320
has kind of normalised,

120
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,800
living standards for ordinary people

121
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,160
are still significantly worse.

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
There's two things about this.

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,560
The first one is that

124
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,840
I think this firstly underlines

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,920
that the thing I've been saying for a long time,

126
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,960
which is what we are seeing economically,

127
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,720
the reason for the fall in living conditions

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
is not

129
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
about

130
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,440
supply chain problems during Covid,

131
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
or about the aftermath of the Ukraine war.

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,720
What we are seeing

133
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
is a permanent decrease in living standards

134
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,840
because we had a permanent increase in inequality.

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,120
I think the first thing is

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,200
it's becoming harder

137
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
to spin what you are seeing as temporary,

138
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,160
because it's becoming more increasingly permanent.

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,240
The second thing about that

140
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,680
is it creates

141
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,120
this kind of interesting situation in politics,

142
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,160
which is

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,840
basically every country that

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,800
had an election,

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
the political party

146
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
that was in power significantly lost their election.

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
They got basically smashed.

148
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,240
And this is because people are seeing, well,

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
the economy is permanently

150
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,080
broken and people want change.

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,720
And yet no political party

152
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,000
has really sort of got a pitch.

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,560
So as the center has failed

154
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,040
and there's been a loss of faith,

155
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
a loss of faith in this idea

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,120
that what's happening is temporary.

157
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,400
An increasing demand in you need to fix it.

158
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,120
You need to change what's happening.

159
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,200
The center has collapsed

160
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
and you're seeing basically

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
a complete political reformation.

162
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,960
What you have is

163
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
political parties

164
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,080
need to change their messaging on the economy.

165
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,600
They need to say,

166
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
we're going to do something dramatically different,

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
and you're starting to see

168
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,120
those new kind of messages take shape.

169
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,680
So I think when you talk about the

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
US election,

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,320
you can kind of see, and also the UK election really,

172
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,320
you can kind of see what the new message is

173
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,720
from the right of politics,

174
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,800
which is the problem is migration,

175
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,280
the problem is foreigners.

176
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,600
And if you want to fix the problem,

177
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,160
we need to be tough on migration.

178
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,320
We need to be tough on foreigners.

179
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
You can see that in Trump's rhetoric.

180
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,280
You can see that in Nigel Farage’s rhetoric over here.

181
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,680
You can see that in basically

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
all of the politics of Europe.

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,480
That is basically a new message being put together.

184
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,800
And that is a smart message.

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,320
And the...

186
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,280
That is a message

187
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,920
which has been very popular throughout history.

188
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,440
You know, we saw this in the early 20th century

189
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,720
from the political right.

190
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,520
The reason that is smart is because when these

191
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,040
anti-immigration, anti-foreigner

192
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,640
political parties get into power

193
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,320
and they increasingly will get into power,

194
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,960
we’re seeing it across Europe,

195
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,760
we're seeing in the States

196
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,040
as these guys get into power,

197
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,280
they will fail to fix the economy.

198
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
And the reason they will fail to fix

199
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,440
the economy is because they are not dealing

200
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,920
with the fundamental problem,

201
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,640
which is growing wealth inequality.

202
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,320
But you've kind of got your excuse already built in,

203
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,960
which is we tried our best

204
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,960
to hit the foreigners, to hit the immigrants.

205
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,600
The left didn't let us go far enough.

206
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,320
You need to let us go further.

207
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,760
And you know, this is the kind of slide

208
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
which we saw in the early 20th century,

209
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
which led eventually to people

210
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
like Hitler and Mussolini getting into power.

211
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,960
And I want to be clear,

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,920
I'm not saying that Trump is Hitler.

213
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,120
I'm not saying that Farage is Hitler,

214
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
these guys will win power,

215
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,720
they will fail to fix the economy

216
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,840
and the obvious political move

217
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,480
then, will be to go further right.

218
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,640
And whilst these guys themselves are not Hitler,

219
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,240
the only path

220
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,680
that they will be able to go as they fail,

221
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,000
because they can't deal with inequality,

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,640
because they're not dealing with the inequality,

223
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,040
they will simply be forced further

224
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
and further right over time,

225
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,760
and you will see more and more

226
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,200
increasingly far right politicians getting into power.

227
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Basically. And that's the new space on the right.

228
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,560
So what's the new space on the left?

229
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
And I think that is where we start

230
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,920
talking about the Labour budget and the election.

231
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,000
So Labour won the election,

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,560
on an extremely small number of votes.

233
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
They actually got,

234
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,200
I think, 5% less votes than they got in 2019

235
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,280
where they got absolutely smashed.

236
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,920
So the actual number of votes went down

237
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,320
and they won simply because of complete collapse

238
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,160
in popularity of the Conservative Party.

239
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,120
So they didn't really need

240
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,520
to have much of an economic message

241
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,120
because they won simply sort of

242
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,600
by default of not being the Conservatives.

243
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,280
And then what did they want to do

244
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,000
when they're in power?

245
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,760
I think if you were to pull

246
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,480
an average man or a woman

247
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,120
to the side in the street and say,

248
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,360
what do you think is Labour’s economic plan?

249
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
What do you think is Keir Starmer's economic plan?

250
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,000
I think most people would not know what it was.

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,080
I don't think they have a clearly

252
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,400
communicated economic plan.

253
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,040
And if you were to ask me what it was,

254
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,000
it's kind of a just a, let's just be really sensible.

255
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,280
It's kind of a new, sensible-ism,

256
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,520
this kind of belief that if you just do the status quo

257
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,360
hard enough, if you're just

258
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,680
sensible enough, things will get better.

259
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,280
It's pretty weak. It will fail.

260
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,520
And I think it's interesting to look at

261
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,040
what happened in the budget,

262
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,160
which it was a relatively modest budget.

263
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,280
They raised taxes a very small amount.

264
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,680
They raised spending a very small amount.

265
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,280
They raised borrowing by a very small amount.

266
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,840
And yet people weren't happy with it.

267
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,880
And the financial markets

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
almost refused the budget really.

269
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,720
You saw government borrowing costs go up a little bit.

270
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,120
I think what it shows basically, is that Labour

271
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
and the left are basically clinging

272
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
to a failed economic orthodoxy.

273
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,360
Increasingly, what is clear is

274
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,320
we live in an economy where more and more

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
and more is being owned by the rich.

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
So you are left with basically a choice.

277
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,200
Either you tax the rich more

278
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,520
or you just accept that you are poor now.

279
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
And the government is sort of

280
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,680
trying to tow this middle ground.

281
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
We're going to borrow a bit more.

282
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,960
We're going to spend a bit more,

283
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,040
it's not going to work.

284
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,440
It's going to fail. And,

285
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,160
we're not going to see economic improvement.

286
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
Okay. So what does that mean?

287
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
We are still living in an economy

288
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,240
which is dominated by the growth in inequality

289
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,080
that happened over Covid.

290
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,520
We are seeing the consequences,

291
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,080
which you would imagine you would see

292
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,280
if you significantly increased economic inequality,

293
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,960
which is a significant increase

294
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,400
in living standards for the rich

295
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,520
and a significant decrease

296
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,400
in living standards for the rest.

297
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,600
Once you increase inequality...

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,840
Well, first thing I would say is

299
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,240
we are not going to see the kind of rapid declines

300
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,880
we saw during Covid unless there is another

301
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,440
economic disaster, because

302
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,760
that rapid speed of

303
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,280
increase in inequality was a one off.

304
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,200
But that leaves us now at a high level of inequality.

305
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,280
And if inequality is higher,

306
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,840
that means ordinary

307
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,280
people are paying more interest to the rich.

308
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
The government is paying more interest to the rich.

309
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Ordinary people are paying more rents to the rich,

310
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,680
and the rich are receiving

311
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,320
more interest and more rents.

312
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,640
So high levels of inequality

313
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,360
lead to higher levels

314
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,880
of increasing inequality,

315
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,040
because it leads to high levels of payments

316
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,440
from the poor and from governments to the rich.

317
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,320
So that means we're on basically

318
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,000
a steeper

319
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,280
gradient of permanent decline now,

320
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,720
and you're going to just see this continued

321
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,840
immiseration.

322
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,080
Living standards will continue to fall.

323
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
And at the same time,

324
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,280
because the rich getting richer, asset

325
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,200
prices will continue to increase.

326
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,280
I should probably be clearer

327
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,880
in my predictions about asset prices,

328
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,240
because in the past I predicted very, very aggressive

329
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
rises in asset prices that have happened.

330
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
This time last year,

331
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
I had the massive long position on gold,

332
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,800
and I've really cut it back a lot

333
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,000
because of the unbelievable speed of the increase.

334
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,720
Gold prices and stock price have gone up

335
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,960
unbelievably hugely in the last few years.

336
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,200
I think that's justified

337
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,320
because of the massive increase

338
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,640
of the wealth of the richest.

339
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,240
But I couldn't

340
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,200
tell you with confidence

341
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,360
they'll be higher in a year's time

342
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,200
just because when things go up that quickly,

343
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,840
they do tend to come back down a little bit.

344
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,760
The one thing which I think will really go

345
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,240
this year is house prices.

346
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,200
Interest rates have started to fall.

347
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,440
They will probably continue to fall a little bit more.

348
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,560
We'll probably see another sort of 0.75%, 1% come off

349
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,280
Bank of England

350
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,120
and Federal Reserve US

351
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,160
base rates in the next year or so.

352
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,000
Once those interest rates go,

353
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
house prices will really start to go.

354
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,240
House prices have been kind of left behind

355
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,920
in this really aggressive asset price rally,

356
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,560
and that is because it's much harder

357
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,880
for rich people to directly buy a ton of housing.

358
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,080
So when rich people make an enormous amount of money

359
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,280
like they did in Covid,

360
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,800
it's super easy to go into financial markets,

361
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,120
buy stocks, buy gold.

362
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
And that's why you’ve seen

363
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
this massive increase in stock prices and gold prices.

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,120
It's much more complicated for a rich person

365
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,280
to go out and buy and manage, you know, 100 properties.

366
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,760
The way that rich people buy properties.

367
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,400
And I think I'll probably do a video on this

368
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,160
at some point, is kind of through the banking system

369
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,280
and through the mortgage system.

370
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,640
They put the money in the bank,

371
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,120
and the banks lend you the money to buy a mortgage.

372
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,240
And because interest rates have been so high,

373
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,080
it has made it difficult, basically for ordinary people

374
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
to pass those eligibility checks.

375
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,640
And it's kind of blocking rich people

376
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,480
from buying housing.

377
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,440
What they want to do is lend you money

378
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
so you can buy a house,

379
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
and they kind of indirectly

380
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,320
own your house through your mortgage,

381
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,600
but because of very high interest rates, they’re

382
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,880
not being able to do that.

383
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,240
As soon as rates come down,

384
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,480
you're really going to start seeing house prices go up.

385
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,280
With regards to interest rates and inflation.

386
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,200
These will both come down.

387
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,880
For a long time

388
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,680
I've had kind of a slightly ambiguous view on this,

389
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,760
which is

390
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,800
because the middle class

391
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,840
is being really smashed and ordinary people's

392
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,760
spending power is being really smashed.

393
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,480
This should have the effect

394
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,400
of really bringing prices down

395
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,680
and bringing inflation down,

396
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,360
which should bring interest rates down.

397
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,800
But it also has this secondary effect

398
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,400
of just really massively increasing poverty,

399
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
which then kind of forces

400
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,720
governments to spend a lot more money

401
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,320
because people have like desperate need.

402
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,960
And the government kind of has an obligation

403
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,400
to help the people,

404
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,080
which is why you've seen much higher levels

405
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,640
of spending and government

406
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,280
deficits, sustained high government deficits

407
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,600
and those high government deficits

408
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,800
will tend to end up with the rich

409
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
and will tend to push prices up again.

410
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,360
So there's a kind of a balanced view

411
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,040
on whether inflation rates come down.

412
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,520
I think they will.

413
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
But how quickly

414
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,800
and how far kind of depends on how much money

415
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,600
governments spend.

416
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,680
I think you're kind of getting

417
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,200
to a point here

418
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,880
where basically

419
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,320
nothing governments do works,

420
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,200
and that is because there's this kind of absurd,

421
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,240
really stubborn unwillingness of governments

422
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,120
on either left or right

423
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,280
to accept that inequality might be the problem.

424
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,360
What you're seeing is kind of

425
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,760
you've got an economy that is dying of cancer

426
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,200
and a political system

427
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
that does not believe cancer exists.

428
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,280
So they keep trying to do a lot of sensible

429
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,600
seeming fixes, like more investment.

430
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
And, you know,

431
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,080
let's just, you know, be more efficient

432
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,600
and let's try and search for growth.

433
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
You can't grow your way out of a cancer.

434
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,600
You know, there's a gaping hole

435
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,080
in the bottom of the ship that needs to be fixed.

436
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,000
Neither right nor left has any real understanding.

437
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,120
So I think the only hope we have

438
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,440
if we want to prevent more economic worsening

439
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,360
is to really force this idea

440
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,480
into the political mainstream,

441
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
that inequality is the problem.

442
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,480
Until then,

443
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,360
we will see continued economic worsening

444
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,440
and that will be combined

445
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,680
with continuing rises in asset prices,

446
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,480
which means the rich get richer and richer.

447
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,160
It's another very pessimistic economic picture,

448
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,600
but the only chance we have to prevent

449
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,600
this is to really drive

450
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,120
inequality as the cause of the economic worsening

451
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,960
into the public narrative,

452
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,200
into the public consciousness,

453
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
and into the minds of the politicians.

454
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,680
Labour are going to fail on the economy,

455
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,240
and they'll be very unpopular in 2 or 3 years.

456
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,280
The only thing I can do, and I would hope

457
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,120
for any of your support,

458
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,680
is try and make this channel big enough

459
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,960
that in 3 or 4 years time,

460
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,640
when the next elections coming around

461
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,200
and Labour are in desperate need of a rebrand,

462
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,560
that we are the best alternative,

463
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,120
that's a big ambition, but I

464
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,720
think it's our only chance.

465
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,120
Inequality is worsening. It will keep getting worse.

466
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,480
The economy will keep getting worse.

467
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
We can fix it.

468
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
We can reduce inequality.

469
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,640
It's about taxing you less and taxing the rich more.

470
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,840
We will be campaigning for it all year long.

471
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,320
As long as I can keep it up.

472
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
And we're grateful for your support. Thank you.
