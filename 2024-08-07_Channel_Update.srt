1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay guys welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,240
Today

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,400
we are going to do a final channel

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,280
update before I go on holiday.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,360
Okay I'm talking to you today on the 25th of June.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,320
We won't put this video out until much later.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,880
In the middle of the start

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,520
of a beautiful London heatwave.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,720
I am about to

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,840
fly off to Japan in a few days to finally do

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,560
this long cycle I've wanted to do for ages.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,240
so I thought it'd be a nice time

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,280
to just look back a little bit on what has been

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,240
a mad year for me and for the channel

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,240
and for the world and talk a little bit

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,080
about what we've achieved

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,800
and what we're going to do in the future.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,600
So the first thing to say is,

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,720
of course, that this year has been basically

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,560
just a massive, massive year for growth on the channel.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,440
At the moment I'm shooting this, we are

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
about 275,000 subs on YouTube.

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,200
A year ago that was something like 80,000.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,440
We've had massive growth on Instagram, on TikTok.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,400
We've started to really cut through

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,480
quite a lot, basically.

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,440
And that's

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,160
thanks to a lot of your support sharing the videos.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,400
Thanks to a lot of hard work

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
from the team that we've put together.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
And yes, something to be proud of,

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,240
in terms of how we're affecting

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,160
the conversation.

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,080
You know, my aim

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,520
with this

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,160
channel has always been basically

37
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,920
to build the bridge between

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,120
inequality and the economy.

39
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,520
I think that

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,800
almost everybody agrees

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,960
that high levels of inequality are a bad thing,

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,240
but I think people have

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,000
believed or been kind of fooled

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,200
into believing for a long time that

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
high levels of inequality

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,760
are kind of

47
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,480
a necessary sacrifice,

48
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,160
kind of the price you pay for a good economy

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,000
in a capitalist society.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,760
But those of you who know my history will know

51
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,280
I made a lot of money basically

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
betting that high inequality

53
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,440
will destroy the economy in the long term.

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,880
And what I really want to do

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,120
is get people to see

56
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
the things that are happening

57
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,600
in the real economy, in their real lives.

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,040
Increased difficulty with

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
buying houses,

60
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,600
in many cases, just paying the rent, buying food

61
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,400
and connect them

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
with the really rapidly

63
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,400
growing inequality we're seeing in society.

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
I think that if we can get people

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
to recognise that

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,640
the reason that they or their kids

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,120
or their grandkids are struggling

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,400
economically is because of growing inequality,

69
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
and that problem will get worse and worse,

70
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,160
that we can start to take action on it. And,

71
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,920
we definitely have been making progress on that.

72
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,680
This year, I brought in for the first time

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
a couple of professionals.

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,040
Professional videographer,

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,760
professional channel manager

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,400
to help me manage the growth of the channel

77
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,320
during the book release. And,

78
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
in order to do that,

79
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,880
we went and got some funding from like a big

80
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,640
charitable foundation here in London.

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,840
They do a lot of work on inequality.

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
That's why they funded us.

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,840
And, they've been sort of surveying people,

84
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,680
and they've found there's been a massive increase in

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
people who think that the reason

86
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,040
the economy is bad is because of

87
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,120
growing inequality, basically. And,

88
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,480
you know, when I heard that,

89
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,320
I was really proud because that's

90
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,520
partly, I think because of this channel.

91
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,160
And I think that's partly

92
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,920
because of the work that we do here.

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,320
So we're getting out there, we're reaching people,

94
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,480
we're still not reaching enough people.

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
I think still, most people in the country don't realise

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
growing inequality is the reason for growing poverty,

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
for growing difficulties in their lives.

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,320
But we are making progress.

99
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,200
I watch a lot of news in the morning

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,280
because I want to see what people are being told,

101
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,360
and I watch the most basic commonplace news in the UK.

102
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
I watch BBC news and Sky news.

103
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,240
And I was watching

104
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,440
BBC radio five live

105
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,480
while I was eating breakfast the other day and,

106
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,600
they were interviewing a Green candidate.

107
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,520
We mentioned on another video

108
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
that the Greens have basically adopted

109
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,160
our policies of a wealth tax.

110
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,120
And I was watching the interviews and

111
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
nobody was talking about wealth inequality,

112
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,120
and it was kind of making me think like,

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,160
what more do we have to do to really get this issue

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
really into the discussion

115
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,880
so that mainstream politicians have to talk about it.

116
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,400
So it has to be mentioned.

117
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
And exactly when I,

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,160
was thinking

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,440
that I was eating my porridge, there was a caller,

120
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,200
a lady called Helen from Burnley called in and,

121
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,080
she basically said, you know,

122
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,840
are you guys aware of how much money

123
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,480
has being given out

124
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,160
during Covid, the government deficit,

125
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,960
since Covid is £700 billion

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,040
and are you aware of where that money's ended up?

127
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Whether it's ended up with the richest people,

128
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
whether it's increased inequality?

129
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,680
Because what I'm seeing is

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
a massive increase in the wealth

131
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
of billionaires and millionaires.

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,720
And, I don't think people are talking about it.

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,880
People aren’t doing anything about it. And,

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,360
it was immediately obvious

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,880
because nobody else really talks about these issues

136
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
and because of the language

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,240
she was using that she got that information

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720
from this channel. And,

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
you know, I know that's a one off instance,

140
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
but it was quite emotional for me to see that we’re

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,600
starting to cut through, we’re stating

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
to affect the conversation.

143
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
And I think that's,

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
that's something we can all be proud of.

145
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
It's part of the conversation now.

146
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,120
But at the same time, realistically,

147
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,400
it's not a central enough part.

148
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,720
I think we're starting to make cuts

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
throughs with people on the street,

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,800
but we're seeing a lot of other problems coming in.

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,400
The rhetoric that the problems are primarily

152
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,520
caused by immigration

153
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,560
is growing and growing and growing.

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,200
Partly because of the, you know, the resurgence

155
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,840
in the return of Nigel Farage.

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,320
His voice is way, way, way louder than mine.

157
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,480
And,

158
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,840
because this inequality problem is not being fixed, it

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,000
inevitable that the economic problems

160
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,720
and the living standards

161
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,800
problems will keep getting worse

162
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,920
and people will become very dissatisfied

163
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
with the incoming Labour government.

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,760
They'll become very dissatisfied with the status quo.

165
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,080
They’ll want change,

166
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,520
and they'll be looking for an alternative. And,

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,600
at this point in time,

168
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,960
when you look at the loudness of ‘the

169
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
problem is immigration’ versus

170
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,560
the loudness of ‘the problem is inequality’,

171
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
it's really hard to see them not winning.

172
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,000
And, I want to be really clear when I say this.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
You know, I'm not saying that immigration doesn't

174
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,880
cause economic problems for certain groups of people,

175
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,520
you know. In fact, I think it probably does.

176
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
I think the problem you have here

177
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,640
is that it is going to drown out this narrative.

178
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,480
And if we don't win this narrative, then

179
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,440
the economy will continue to collapse, basically.

180
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,400
That's the problem on one side.

181
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,120
On the other side,

182
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,080
we have an incoming Labour government,

183
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,800
who are advised by a group of mainstream economists

184
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
and journalists

185
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,680
who are super, super resistant to taxation.

186
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,360
There was a tweet by a guy, what was his name?

187
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,640
Dan Neidle recently, which said,

188
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,600
if taxing wealth is so easy, why doesn't anybody do it?

189
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
And he showed that, you know, across the world,

190
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,720
wealth taxation is quite low.

191
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,240
And, I thought that was quite funny because, you know,

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
what we have at the moment is a situation

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,480
where basically across the Western world,

194
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,400
living standards are falling.

195
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,080
And it's pretty clear that what is being done

196
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,320
across the Western world is

197
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,760
a kind of a unanimous shared economic opinion

198
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,160
being driven by these

199
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,280
relatively well-paid economists.

200
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,760
And it's not working. It's not working.

201
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,080
And we need to do something different.

202
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,160
But unfortunately, I think what we have

203
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,760
is a lot of relatively well-paid

204
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,360
economists and academics and politicians

205
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,720
who have decent salaries

206
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,680
and decent houses and mortgages to pay

207
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
that just don't want to pay any more tax, basically.

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
And even though I'm quite explicit,

209
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm not trying to tax them, I'm

210
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,280
trying to tax the very rich.

211
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
I think they're just very instinctively conservative,

212
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,440
very instinctively protective.

213
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
I continue to believe that

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,960
we're not going to get change

215
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,880
delivered to us from well-paid people,

216
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,680
from the richest people in society.

217
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
You know, I would like this sort of...

218
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,680
this well-paid middle class

219
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,720
who are not the sort of asset, super rich

220
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
to support us,

221
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,600
because I would like them to realise that

222
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,360
if things keep going

223
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,040
the way they're going, living standards will collapse.

224
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
And we'll keep

225
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
campaigning them,

226
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,720
we'll keep lobbying the Labour Party,

227
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,440
we’ll keep trying to build support.

228
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,400
But I really don't think we'll win

229
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,480
unless we have ordinary people demanding it.

230
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
So I'm going to keep doing it.

231
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,600
And, we're going to keep pushing it

232
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,720
and hopefully we’ll make it.

233
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,440
But for the moment, I'm going on holiday.

234
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,360
For me personally, it's been an absolutely crazy year.

235
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I wrote a whole book, which, came out in March,

236
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,640
The Trading Game.

237
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,200
I've talked about it a lot on the channel.

238
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,120
It was a Sunday Times

239
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
number one best seller for two weeks.

240
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,480
It was in the top ten for eight or nine weeks.

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,800
I had press

242
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,960
all over the world, loads of press in this country.

243
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
It's blown up

244
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
this channel massively.

245
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,200
I've been getting recognised in the street

246
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,160
a lot, in the gym, in Lidl, all over the place.

247
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,800
And that's great.

248
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
It was always part of the plan

249
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,120
to, sort of, use my face and use my name.

250
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,000
But it's been a lot, basically. It's been a lot.

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,600
I think people who only watch the videos

252
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
probably don't realise that I'm also

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
doing a ton of interviews

254
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,400
for all different press all over the world,

255
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,680
and speaking to people

256
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,520
about how we can sort of grow this movement,

257
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,080
and also like

258
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
thinking all the time about

259
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,880
what are the ways that we can communicate

260
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
to push this message out there.

261
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
And, you know, you write a book,

262
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,840
I was published by Penguin, you know,

263
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,200
you get a massive amount of support,

264
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,680
like I had basically a full time

265
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,080
publicist working with me.

266
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,960
She was amazing.

267
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,800
She has to be like,

268
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,600
take a lot of the credit for

269
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
the growth of this channel.

270
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,680
But at the end of the day, she's trying to sell books.

271
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
She's not trying to push a political message,

272
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,320
you know, and,

273
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
I obviously say,

274
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,240
you know,

275
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,520
I want to try to push this

276
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,680
political message,

277
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,440
but I'm always thinking,

278
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,240
how can we use this publicity and to help grow

279
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,000
these ideas?

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,560
And, it's a lot of work.

281
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,240
It’s been a lot of work creatively.

282
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,640
I'm always thinking about new ways

283
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,400
we can push things creatively. And,

284
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,280
it's just been hard basically, it's exhausting.

285
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm not the kind of person who

286
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,320
loves being recognised in the street.

287
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,040
I don't want to tell people

288
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,120
not to say hi to me in the street

289
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,480
because everyone's really, really nice

290
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,560
and I really appreciate everybody's support.

291
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,000
But it's just weird. It's just I'm no used to it.

292
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,160
I'll get recognised like seven, eight times a day now,

293
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,480
and it's just a bit scary.

294
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,360
And, you know, like,

295
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,120
weird things happen,

296
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,480
like Mail on Sunday did a massive, like,

297
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,440
two page hit piece on me.

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,760
I've got friends from Citibank forwarding

299
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,920
mails from, like,

300
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,720
FT reporters asking if there's any dirt,

301
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
any dirt on Gary Stevenson

302
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
which is stressful and stuff.

303
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,280
You have to sort of,

304
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,080
it’s new for me, stuff you have to deal with.

305
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,560
But really more than anything,

306
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
it's just stressful sort of seeing...

307
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,200
Seeing how difficult it's

308
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
going to be to win this fight.

309
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,840
I think we've got a long way to go

310
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,960
before we get accepted by these sort of

311
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,120
well-paid, fancy posh

312
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,120
economists who don't like the idea of more taxes.

313
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,760
We've had the big boost from the book now.

314
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,680
I need to think about

315
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,120
how can we keep growing it, as well as

316
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,400
how can we keep making content?

317
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,520
And, yeah,

318
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,560
basically the last month or two,

319
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
I've been pretty exhausted, and,

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,120
I've decided to take a bit of time off.

321
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,560
Go back to Japan, where I lived for two years,

322
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,520
do this big cycle I want to do.

323
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,600
Just basically tear away

324
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
and try and sort of refresh myself creatively,

325
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,840
which means that we're pre-recording loads.

326
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,800
I don't think this will go out

327
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,080
until maybe the end of July, maybe even into August,

328
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,520
but we're trying to pre-record loads

329
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,600
so that we don't leave a big gap.

330
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,040
But we might end up doing a gap.

331
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,680
Depends sort of what I need personally.

332
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,640
But I've been thinking about what we're going to do

333
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,920
when we come back.

334
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,600
How we are going to manage the channel.

335
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,280
This year we managed to get, as I've said,

336
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,160
a little bit of external funding on the channel,

337
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,120
and that's basically paid

338
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,760
the wages of my videographer,

339
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,480
my manager, and we’ve got another guy doing subtitling.

340
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
We had somebody help us

341
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,480
with just the branding of the channel a little bit.

342
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,640
But it's tricky,

343
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,240
external funding is tricky because we had,

344
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,400
obviously we had the election called early,

345
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,720
and they didn’t want me to do any political videos.

346
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,080
So, I basically just funded some videos myself.

347
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
And also the funding will run out at some point

348
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,760
and we sort of have to decide what to do.

349
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,320
At the moment,

350
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
the channel is making just kind of roughly enough

351
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,560
from YouTube revenue

352
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,200
to pay for the staff that we've got.

353
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,680
But I think going forward,

354
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,600
if it's going to be really a thing,

355
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm probably going to need more support,

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
a bit more creative support,

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,080
a bit more help

358
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,440
by structuring the videos,

359
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,160
managing the videos, managing the YouTube.

360
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,320
I look at

361
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
how much we’ve grown

362
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,960
because we’ve had a publicist from Penguin,

363
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,040
and I do think if we had some real

364
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,320
PR support on the channel, it could be really bigger.

365
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,000
So,

366
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,280
I've been thinking for a while about whether we should

367
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,960
basically open up for donations

368
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
so that we can hire more staff, and,

369
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,320
I think I'm going to do that.

370
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,240
So what I'm planning at the moment is to

371
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,640
start a not for profit company

372
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,040
so that anyone who donates, can know

373
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,240
for sure that the money is not going to me

374
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,120
and basically open a Patreon,

375
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,720
see if we get some money in,

376
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,920
and then maybe just build up a little pot of cash

377
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,440
so that I can get the support that I need.

378
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,120
I know that with people that say, well,

379
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,920
you're a millionaire, Gary you should fund it, but,

380
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,720
I'm a millionaire that spends most of my time

381
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,120
working for free on a YouTube channel.

382
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,240
So, I don't really

383
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,680
want to start funding it myself as well,

384
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,320
because, I'm already working for free.

385
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,960
I've worked on it for free for a long time, and,

386
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,680
I don’t think it’s going to work basically,

387
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,040
if we're going to have to make it as big as we need,

388
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,840
we're going to need staff.

389
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,040
And I think if we're going to really, really grow,

390
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,120
we're going to need more people. And,

391
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,040
I'm not going to be able to keep funding it myself.

392
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,800
I have funded up till now.

393
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,480
But if it's going to go,

394
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,280
we're going to need a bit more money.

395
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,480
So I think I'm going to open a Patreon.

396
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,680
I'm not going to say to anybody, you need to donate.

397
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,280
You need to donate.

398
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,080
I'm going to open it,

399
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,800
see what we get,

400
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,040
and if we get enough money,

401
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,680
we can hopefully use that to make a few more videos,

402
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,480
mix up a little bit the creative output,

403
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,760
make some longer videos,

404
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,080
get some stuff with animations in.

405
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,600
But yeah, I think that's what we're going to have to do

406
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
because it's just basically

407
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,160
getting too big for me to manage it.

408
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
I want to be able to like, totally split

409
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,320
the finances off.

410
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,440
Really what I want to get is the finances separate.

411
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,960
So I can just focus on the creative side

412
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,560
and not have to worry about having to fund it as well.

413
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,920
So we'll do that.

414
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,640
I'll try and get that sorted,

415
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,280
hopefully before I’m back.

416
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,720
But first and foremost,

417
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,280
I'm going to take a little break, go and chill out.

418
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Try and come back with some good,

419
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,040
creative stuff because,

420
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,520
one video

421
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
a week on top of all of these mental interviews

422
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,160
is quite a lot.

423
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,800
And sometimes I feel a little bit creatively burnt out.

424
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,240
But yeah, I'm not going to stop.

425
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,360
I think the way that this channel

426
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,880
is going to go,

427
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm probably always going to have to

428
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,400
take bits of time out to just escape the pressure

429
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,920
and the constant creative churn,

430
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,560
because it's hard to do something

431
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,120
good, new, creative once a week.

432
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,080
But, I'll keep doing it.

433
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,600
I'll keep doing that at a pace that works for me.

434
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
We'll open for funding, but we won't paywall

435
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,440
any of the content.

436
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,200
We'll just see what we get

437
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,440
and whether that means we can grow

438
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,280
more quickly and get

439
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,200
get more staff and get more support.

440
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
If you do choose to donate,

441
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,720
we'll really appreciate that.

442
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,840
But for now,

443
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,360
thank you very much for all of your support,

444
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,720
whether that's in the last 2 or 3 months,

445
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,280
whether that's in the last 3 or 4 years.

446
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,440
Thanks for your supporting on the channel.

447
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
I really, truly believe if we don't manage

448
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,640
to get some action on this rapidly

449
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,440
growing inequality, that it will have

450
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
a devastating impact on ordinary people.

451
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,400
But I think we can. I think we can do it.

452
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,760
I think if you see the growth of this channel

453
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,640
this year, it shows that demand is there.

454
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,960
I'll do my best to try to get the strategy right.

455
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,120
If we get a bit of funding,

456
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
then I'll try and get some experts in who are not

457
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,360
economists trying to run a YouTube channel on the side.

458
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,960
But we'll keep growing.

459
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,160
We're going to get opportunities here and

460
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,560
people are supporting it,

461
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
and, I'll keep fighting for it

462
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,800
if you keep fighting for it,

463
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,520
but maybe not for the next couple of months.

464
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
Have a good summer. And,

465
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,640
good luck.

466
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,680
Thank you.
