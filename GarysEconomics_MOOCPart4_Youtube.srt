1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,920
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,680
Today we are going to do the fourth part

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,800
of our online course about inequality and the economy.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,400
And we are going to explain

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,920
why wealth inequality is a central problem.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,720
Okay. So we're back on the course again.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,800
So far we've had three episodes.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,280
Episode one was What is Wealth?

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,920
Episode two was What is Wealth Inequality

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,840
and How Does It Affect The Economy?

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,520
And episode three was

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,880
If Inequality Is So Important,

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,320
Why Don't Most Economists Talk About It?

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,640
Today we are going to explain

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,440
how I came to travel from

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,880
being a classically trained economist,

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,280
I did my undergrad at London School of Economics,

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,960
and then I went to work in the city

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,640
to believing

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,360
that, basically, contrary

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,880
to most mainstream economic opinion,

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,840
wealth inequality

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
is actually the central problem

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
that we're facing right now.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,720
Okay, so I studied economics from 2005

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,320
to 2008 at London School of Economics.

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,960
It's a very elite economics university.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,080
It teaches economics in the classic way.

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,840
It doesn't look much at inequality.

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,120
So when I started my first job

31
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,480
outside of university,

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,920
which was as a short

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
term interest rates trader at Citibank,

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,960
I wasn't really thinking about inequality

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,680
or distribution at all.

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,840
I started working full time as a trader

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,600
in June of 2008,

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,360
which is obviously just before the Lehman crisis,

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,760
and a big part of my job and the job of my team was to

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,000
look at central bank base

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,560
rates, central bank interest rates.

42
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,760
So, for example, in this country,

43
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,880
the Bank of England, in the US,

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,120
the Federal Reserve and say, okay, what are they now?

45
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,920
What are they going to be in one years

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
time, in six months time, in two years time?

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
So this is kind of what you would call like

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
a macroeconomic analysis job in a way.

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,600
The central bank is supposed to control inflation

50
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,200
basically when the economy is weak, they cut the rates.

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,480
When the economy is strong

52
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,600
or when the economy is overheating,

53
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,160
from an inflation perspective,

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,040
they increase their rates.

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,080
So really what you're doing

56
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,160
is you're looking at the economy.

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,480
Is it going to be strong? Is it going to be weak?

58
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,880
That was my job. That was my team’s job.

59
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,360
I started there in June 2008,

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,920
which obviously is a few months

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
before the Lehman crisis.

62
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,200
In October 2008, the crisis sort of slowly bubbles.

63
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,760
In October it explodes.

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,880
Lehman goes under.

65
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,440
There's this massive economic collapse.

66
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
I guess some people who watch the channel now

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
might be too young to remember that!

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,040
There was this huge economic collapse.

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,080
Tonnes and tonnes of people lost their jobs.

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,480
It was an economic disaster.

71
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,040
And central banks all across the world,

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,000
including in the US, here in the UK,

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,440
Europe, Australia,

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
they all suddenly slashed their interest rates

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
down to zero.

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,800
This was like a really extreme measure at the time.

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,720
So we're doing this video in the beginning of 2025.

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
We had zero interest rates quite recently,

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
but at the time in 2008, zero interest rates,

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,640
they were like totally new.

81
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,520
Except for in Japan,

82
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,080
which they’d been happening for a while.

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,000
Like before the crisis, central banks

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,600
would move interest rates from like 5.5% to 5.25%.

85
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,880
It was really that kind of like

86
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,560
delicate fine tuning.

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,360
And then suddenly in 2008, you have,

88
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,280
oh my God, this is such a disaster.

89
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,240
They're being cut from like 5.5% to 0%.

90
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,600
Well, technically 0.5%, but this...

91
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,160
this kind of thing across the world,

92
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,680
effectively from 5.5% or 4.5%

93
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,760
down to 0% in a matter of,

94
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,320
you know, a couple of months,

95
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
massive, massive aggressive cuts.

96
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,400
So our job then as interest rate traders,

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,280
from the perspective of predicting

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,280
is to look at the economy and say, okay,

99
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,320
well how long are these rates going to stay at 0% then?

100
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,880
When are they going to come back up?

101
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
How quickly will they come back up?

102
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,200
What level will they go back up to?

103
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,920
And at the time,

104
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
because the interest rates

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
had been cut so aggressively,

106
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,520
and most of these

107
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,080
traders are aware of the basic economic theory,

108
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,760
probably worth covering what economists think here.

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,760
So this response, which happened in 2008,

110
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,240
basically the exact same response

111
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,120
we had in Covid, right, slash

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,480
the interest rates, pushed the interest rates down.

113
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,840
This is a very classic modern economic response, right?

114
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,360
This is how modern economists

115
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,760
want to manage the economy.

116
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,920
It's all about interest rate management.

117
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,360
There's an economic weakness.

118
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,600
You reduce the interest rates

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,040
and the economic theory is quite simple right.

120
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,800
Interest rates are lower.

121
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,680
You're not making any money for saving.

122
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,560
You can borrow cheaply. It's the same for businesses.

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
There's no point saving money. You can borrow cheaply.

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
Go out and spend.

125
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
Go out and spend money.

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Borrow money, invest, build up your business.

127
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,920
Borrow and spend, it’s free, super cheap to borrow. And

128
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,320
bear in mind, right before

129
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,240
2008, we would cut the rate from 5.5% to 5.25% and

130
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,360
expect that to make like a significant difference, right.

131
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,000
So we believed and, economies still do believe,

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,960
that these small interest rate

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,520
changes make a big difference to the economy.

134
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,760
And during 2008, we had these massive changes.

135
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,560
And the general economic consensus on

136
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
that was and still is,

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,080
these stimulate the economy,

138
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,600
but it takes a bit of time,

139
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,080
takes generally

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
they like to say 18 months, a year

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
and a half, takes that sort of time

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,960
for these interest rate movements

143
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,280
to affect, influence the economy.

144
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,440
So when we had these massive,

145
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,640
massive interest rate cuts,

146
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,840
everybody was saying like,

147
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
oh my God, like, this might be too much.

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,640
We're going to see like a massive economic bounce back.

149
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,840
You know, you might see a spike in inflation.

150
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,440
People were even talking about hyper inflation.

151
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,960
And speaking

152
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,000
now in 2025,

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,760
I think you have to point out that a lot of this

154
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,440
narrative was quite similar

155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,000
to the narrative during Covid,

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
which is when you have these massive,

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
massive movements in interest rates.

158
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,480
They're so economically stimulative

159
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,600
that we are going to see like a massive bounce back.

160
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
And, you know, people now

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,160
might not remember the media during the 2008 crisis,

162
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,600
but they'll probably remember

163
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,040
media saying during Covid,

164
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
we're going to have a roaring ‘20s.

165
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,680
There's going to be all this pent up demand.

166
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,560
In a lot of ways, it was quite similar.

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,680
People were saying these massive moves in interest

168
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,320
rates will cause massive economic stimulus.

169
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,520
And basically

170
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,440
when you're a trader,

171
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,720
you can just look at the markets, right.

172
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,360
And the markets will say,

173
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,120
we think interest rates next year will be x, right.

174
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,200
So interest rates

175
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,360
went down to like 0.5% here in the UK.

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,040
Pretty much the same in the US, Europe.

177
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,680
And you can say what would they be next year?

178
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,040
What will they be in two years time?

179
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,840
And everybody was like,

180
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,040
well we're gonna have such a big bounce back

181
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960
that these interest rates are going

182
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
to come massively up.

183
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,680
I was really young, I was only 21...

184
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,720
well I turned 22, during the Lehman crisis,

185
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,960
very young,

186
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,520
naive, inexperienced trader,

187
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,440
fresh out of university studying economics.

188
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,160
So I just...

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
you just... you kind of accept it, right.

190
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,480
I was busy, you know,

191
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
trying to make money in other ways.

192
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,720
There was a lot of sort of kind of easy money

193
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,920
to be made at that time in my area.

194
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,080
And I just kind of accepted,

195
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,680
I wasn't really getting too involved in, you know,

196
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,400
looking at these economic predictions

197
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,520
and like most 22 year olds

198
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,800
fresh out of economics university,

199
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
I thought, well, yeah, they’re probably right.

200
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,920
They probably know they're talking about.

201
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,640
And I expected, like everybody else, rapid recovery,

202
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,760
rapid bounce back in interest rates.

203
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Obviously, we know now that didn't happen.

204
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,200
So I sat through 2009

205
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,640
and the interest rates didn't go up.

206
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,840
And people were kind of saying,

207
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,040
well, you know, it takes 18 months.

208
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,960
So, you know, this was a particularly bad crisis.

209
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,840
Maybe it's going to take a little bit longer,

210
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,360
give it a bit more time.

211
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,040
So we get to the end of 2009

212
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,600
and the narrative is kind of unchanged.

213
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, we were wrong, rates haven't gone up yet,

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,280
but next year rates will definitely go up.

215
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
Obviously again, we know now

216
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
we sat through the whole of 2010

217
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,520
and rate stayed 0% all across the world.

218
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,480
And you know, I'm getting a bit older,

219
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,920
getting a bit more experienced by the end of 2010.

220
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,360
I would have just turned 24

221
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
and I've got a couple of years

222
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,680
experience as a trader now.

223
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,040
We get into the beginning of 2011

224
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,080
and a lot of people don't remember this,

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,080
but there was a kind of mini inflation crisis in 2011

226
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
that was quite similar in a lot of ways,

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,480
although less extreme

228
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,400
than the inflation crisis we had just after Covid,

229
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,440
which was inflation shot up,

230
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,960
it was much higher than the 2% target,

231
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,080
I think, going up in this country to nearly 6%.

232
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,720
I don't think ever quite hit 6%.

233
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,240
It was driven primarily by energy and food,

234
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
similarly to Covid.

235
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
So we had this inflation

236
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,880
crisis coming in in the beginning of 2011,

237
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,840
and then people were like,

238
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,880
well, this is really going to be it now, you know,

239
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,560
we not only have

240
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,360
we got all this money flooding in and governments

241
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,000
are running a massive deficit, similarly to Covid.

242
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We had this quantitative easing programs

243
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
which are designed to push

244
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
even more money into the economy.

245
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
So you've got zero interest rates, quantitative easing,

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
massive government deficits,

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,120
just like Covid,

248
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,880
all this money

249
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,520
getting pushed in, so much money getting pushed in

250
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,240
and now you're starting to see inflation go.

251
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
And everybody at the beginning of 2011 was like,

252
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,840
well now it's really, really going to happen.

253
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,760
And by then I was 24 and I'd witnessed,

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,200
you know, two and a half years,

255
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,560
three years really of like really,

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
really bad

257
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,080
economic predictions by not just the traders, like,

258
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,200
this is pretty much a broad economic consensus.

259
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
You’re always going to get a few people who disagree.

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,360
But most traders, most economists

261
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,680
said the same thing throughout.

262
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:41,880
You know,

263
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,160
they didn't predict the 2008 financial crisis.

264
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,480
There was this famous moment

265
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,720
when did you know the Queen visited LSE,

266
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,840
did you hear about this?

267
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,640
The Queen visited LSE

268
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,600
and, just on some sort of visit,

269
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,640
and she asked one of the professor,

270
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,880
so why didn't you predict the economic crisis then?

271
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,560
Yeah, 2008 crisis comes,

272
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,520
you know, some sort of lone voices called it,

273
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,120
but in general, the economic establishment

274
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
hadn't predicted it.

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,720
Definitely nothing of that scale.

276
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,040
2009 big recovery didn't happen.

277
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,440
2010 big recovery didn't happen.

278
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,920
We’re sitting at the beginning of 2011

279
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,600
and everybody's like,

280
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,920
now we're going to have a massive recovery.

281
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,560
And I had started to become

282
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,640
like very cynical, basically.

283
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I was making a half million

284
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
pound a year

285
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,680
in my early 20s,

286
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,120
and people around me are obviously making millions.

287
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
And you see them just consistently wrong.

288
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,280
You start to get to know these guys. And I was lucky.

289
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,160
Like, I worked with some really smart people.

290
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
But if you...

291
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,320
the majority of the people

292
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,160
on the trading floor, to be honest,

293
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,000
these are just basically guys from rich families.

294
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,640
And I think if you come from a rich family,

295
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,440
it's kind of the norm to end up at an elite university

296
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,720
and get a job like something on the trading floor.

297
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,480
So you know, you sit there two and a half years,

298
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
you start to realise, like, actually

299
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,960
most of the guys making these calls, the economists,

300
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,280
the traders, and they're consistently wrong.

301
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,800
They've been wrong here for like three years. And,

302
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,200
you know, my job was

303
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,800
to be a trader,

304
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
so if you can out predict

305
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,000
these guys you can make a lot of money.

306
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,960
So I'm not going to pretend

307
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,320
that my motivation was at all altruistic.

308
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,480
It was like,

309
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,200
you know, here I am, top degree from a top university

310
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,400
on one of the biggest trading floors in the world.

311
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,480
And you start realising,

312
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,600
these guys around me, they just wrong.

313
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,280
They just wrong. They're wrong every year.

314
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,320
And you start realising, well,

315
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm in as good a situation as anybody

316
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,760
to figure out why these guys are wrong, basically.

317
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:36,960
You know,

318
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,480
I've got the elite degree just like everybody else.

319
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,120
You know, I'm in the best place.

320
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
These are the top paid economists.

321
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,400
These are the top paid traders.

322
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,000
And they're wrong.

323
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
So it was actually really exciting,

324
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,640
this exciting realisation

325
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,240
that you're here

326
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,760
on the cutting edge of like a really important thing,

327
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
like economics and everybody's wrong.

328
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,040
So we need to figure out why they're wrong.

329
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
Because if we can, we can make a ton of money.

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,000
So I started to think a lot about, okay,

331
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
well what's the theory?

332
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,680
And I'll explain the theory to you,

333
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,280
which is low interest rates get people spending

334
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,880
because it's cheap to borrow money.

335
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,240
There's no point saving money.

336
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,480
So people should be spending

337
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,920
and all the economic theory says

338
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,000
that people should be spending,

339
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,040
people should be spending, people should be spending.

340
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,440
And yet there I was, early 2011,

341
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,040
and people were not spending.

342
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,920
So there's...

343
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,600
what you can do then, and what I was able to do is,

344
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,480
you can kind of boil down

345
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,120
this really important economic problem of

346
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,880
why is the economy like consistently sh*t?

347
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,720
To a much more objective answerable

348
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,080
question of why aren't people spending money?

349
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,280
And I spent a lot of time

350
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,800
thinking about that simple question of,

351
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
why aren't people spending money?

352
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,280
And, you know, I was young, I was 24.

353
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,640
You don't know that much when you’re 24.

354
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,960
I just went and started asking people,

355
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,200
and I think this is where I had quite a big advantage

356
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,840
over a lot of other economists, a lot of other traders,

357
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,400
because I come from a poor background,

358
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,800
I was just a lot closer to just ordinary people.

359
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
And, you know,

360
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,440
if you ask ordinary people, and I did

361
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
and I think this is a really useful thing to do,

362
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
if you ask them, why don't you spend more money?

363
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,640
You know, the answer

364
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
then was exactly the same

365
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,160
as what the answer now would be.

366
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,360
The vast majority of people just said, well,

367
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,080
I don't spend any money

368
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,520
because I don't have any more money.

369
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,760
Most people were basically,

370
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,680
you know, money in, money out, you know,

371
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,920
very often money in was less than money out.

372
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,280
You know, they were struggling to spend money.

373
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,600
And I think this is where my experience was different

374
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
from a lot of economists and a lot of traders,

375
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,760
because if you were to ask people

376
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,080
from rich families that,

377
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,920
they can't say that

378
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,800
and they wouldn't say

379
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,840
they that, it wouldn’t makes sense to say that.

380
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,880
Most people from rich families,

381
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
they're not constrained by their income.

382
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,080
Their income is more than their expenditure.

383
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,320
They save every month.

384
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,520
So what I was seeing was, I think, the correct answer

385
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,920
to the very simple question,

386
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,880
why aren't people spending money,

387
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,000
which is the core question of why is the economy weak,

388
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,240
which was that people didn't have any money.

389
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,520
And that sat in my head for a bit.

390
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,680
And at the time I was working with, I had hired,

391
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,560
a junior trader, an Italian guy.

392
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,840
He’s in the book, so I can't use his real name.

393
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
In the book he’s called Titzy.

394
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,800
Really smart kid, Italian kid,

395
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,400
went to Bocconi which is basically the Italian LSE,

396
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
and I sort of like, I poke this question around at him.

397
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,640
Okay, well why why maybe people don't have any money.

398
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,560
And he would say,

399
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,800
and we would discuss the fact

400
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
that it's kind of impossible

401
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,520
for nobody to have any money.

402
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,600
And we've done videos on this channel

403
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
about what is money, this kind of thing.

404
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,960
Money is basically a spreadsheet.

405
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,920
There's winners and losers.

406
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
It has to balance out. It has to add up.

407
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,520
That is the way our current monetary system works.

408
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,320
It doesn't make sense to say, like,

409
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,400
nobody has any money.

410
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
And furthermore, beyond that,

411
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,080
like other than money, there exists real wealth.

412
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,720
You know, we covered it on part one, What is Wealth?

413
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,080
And, you know,

414
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,720
the wealth wasn't disappearing, you know.

415
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,240
The houses are still here, you know,

416
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,400
the resources are still here,

417
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,760
the businesses are still here,

418
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,800
the buildings are still here.

419
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
And that's what most of wealth is.

420
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,440
So, you know, the wealth is not disappearing.

421
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
Somebody has to have the money.

422
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,720
And yet when you ask people,

423
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,480
why don't they spend money?

424
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
They're like, well, I don't have any money.

425
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,080
And this kind of didn't make any sense.

426
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,520
And that was bouncing around in my head, early 2011.

427
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,240
And then I got called into a meeting.

428
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,320
So I was still a junior traded then, but I used to...

429
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,680
the previous manager had allowed me to come

430
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,400
to like the meeting

431
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
of all the senior managers to bring the sandwiches.

432
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,440
So I was able to go to these like quite senior

433
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,400
economist meetings,

434
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,080
and a really good Citibank economist...

435
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm sometimes quite mean about economists,

436
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,400
but there are good ones.

437
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,720
And I thought this guy was a good economist.

438
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,520
He showed us all these slides

439
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,240
going through the fiscal situation,

440
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,880
the financial position

441
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,000
of a lot of major world governments.

442
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,560
So you probably remember maybe some people don't.

443
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,120
In 2011,

444
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,360
after this meeting,

445
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,200
there was a crisis of the financial position

446
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,720
of major European governments,

447
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,080
and it was centered on

448
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,600
Italy, Greece, Spain,

449
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,920
Portugal, Ireland,

450
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,760
were the ones who were central in it.

451
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,920
Before that crisis blew up, this guy kind of spotted

452
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,560
oh this could blow up.

453
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,280
And he said, well,

454
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,720
if you look at all of these countries,

455
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,080
they're spending more than they make every year.

456
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,360
They're having to sell their assets,

457
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
they're going into debt.

458
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,800
And it wasn't just those countries

459
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,560
that were central in that 2011 crisis.

460
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,760
The situation in the UK was not much better.

461
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,280
Situation of the US, not much better.

462
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,880
Situation in Japan, not much better. So

463
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,760
what you have here is basically governments

464
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,200
also can't spend because they don’t have any more money

465
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,160
and they're running their wealth down.

466
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
And that really reminded me of

467
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,120
when my friend said, we don't have any more money.

468
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,000
You know, I didn't...

469
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I didn't just accept that face value.

470
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,160
I kind of dug into a little bit

471
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,000
where I could

472
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,880
and what I kind of found was the big,

473
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,400
the big problem for my friends and their families was

474
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,360
the kids couldn't

475
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,480
see how they would ever be able to afford a property.

476
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,000
And what's important about that

477
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,360
is so, I'm 38 now, In 2011, I was in my mid 20s.

478
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
Our parents generation, you know,

479
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,000
even my parents, I come from quite a poor background.

480
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,160
They all own property.

481
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,560
You know,

482
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,400
I went to grammar school,

483
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,760
so I didn't know like the poorest people.

484
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,320
But, you know,

485
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,120
most of my parents generation, they own property.

486
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,320
They own property. And yet my generation

487
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,920
could in many cases never afford to own property.

488
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,960
So what you are seeing

489
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
there is the families,

490
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,600
ordinary families

491
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,040
going over time

492
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,480
from being property owning to not property owning.

493
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,640
And I think once you understand that,

494
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,560
it doesn't make any sense to really ask the question of

495
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,600
why don't you spend more money?

496
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,640
Because what you recognise

497
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,160
then is these guys, their wealth

498
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
trajectory over

499
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,680
time is going down to zero,

500
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,280
which means the family as a whole

501
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,520
spending more than their income.

502
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
And if you're already spending more than your income,

503
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,680
you can't long term spend more.

504
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,080
And then I went into this meeting about governments.

505
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
And it's basically the same.

506
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,680
Families spending more on their income,

507
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,280
losing their assets, going into debt.

508
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,560
Governments losing their income...

509
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,680
spending more than their income,

510
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,840
losing assets, going into debt.

511
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
And the thing...

512
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,320
you might think

513
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,880
I came out of that meeting thinking like,

514
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,560
oh my God, like, this is a disaster,

515
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
Western countries are going to collapse.

516
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,000
But what was really in

517
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
my head was the kind of systemic impossibility of this.

518
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,920
It's not possible

519
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,040
for everyone to spend more than their income.

520
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,360
It's not possible.

521
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,560
As a society. Spending and income has to be the same.

522
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,760
You can only consume what you produce.

523
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,000
This is, this is the way that it is.

524
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
And it's not possible for everybody to go into debt.

525
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,440
And we've done videos on this, videos on this,

526
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,280
but and you can go look at them.

527
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,160
But if one group goes into debt,

528
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,280
some group must be accumulating

529
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,160
credit, like this has to balance out.

530
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,000
And it's not possible

531
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,440
for everybody to lose their assets.

532
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,400
Not unless there's been an earthquake,

533
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,120
which they hadn't been.

534
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,480
You know, the assets that existed. Right.

535
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,960
So I was just sitting there and I was thinking,

536
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,760
people aren't spending

537
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,080
because they're losing their assets.

538
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,360
Which means they’re actually spending more

539
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,440
than they can possibly spend.

540
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,520
Governments aren't spending

541
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,760
because they're losing their assets,

542
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
which means that they're spending more

543
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,800
than they can possibly spend in the long run.

544
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,160
It just doesn't balance.

545
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
It's not possible. Where are they?

546
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,240
It was as if everything was like being taken by aliens,

547
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,480
you know, as if all of the assets.

548
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,840
And then obviously

549
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm sitting there on the Citibank trading floor

550
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,880
as somebody who had been paid nearly £500,000

551
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
the previous two years surrounded by millionaires.

552
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
And then you just suddenly realise like,

553
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,600
oh my God, like

554
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,360
we are the balance or the balance is us, like and

555
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,160
and not just us.

556
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,200
Because of course, you know,

557
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,800
whilst we were rich people,

558
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
the people whose money we moving

559
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,040
are even richer people.

560
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,280
And you start realising,

561
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,560
oh, and you know, at that time, similarly to now,

562
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,320
the stock market was ripping to all time highs

563
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,280
and you were starting to see like house prices

564
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,920
starting to move

565
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,440
and the gold price was starting to go

566
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,040
and you starting to...

567
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,200
and I suddenly realised, like

568
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,960
the reason that families are losing their homes

569
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
and the reason that governments are going

570
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
bankrupt is because the wealth

571
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,120
that used to be being held

572
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,400
by ordinary families and by governments

573
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,000
is being transferred to the rich and the super rich.

574
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,400
And once I realised that,

575
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
I realised immediately

576
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,240
that is a problem which would worsen over time,

577
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,000
because if families and governments

578
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,880
can't afford to run a balanced budget

579
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,680
when they own their own properties,

580
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,240
when they have some wealth,

581
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
well, they definitely can't afford

582
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
to run a balanced budget

583
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,800
when they don't own the property

584
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,400
and when they don't have wealth,

585
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,600
because now they've lost that passive income.

586
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,800
They need to pay to rent those things.

587
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,240
And if the rich can afford to outcompete the middle

588
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
at this lower level of wealth,

589
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,480
well, now they're richer.

590
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,440
They've got more passive income,

591
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
they can out compete them even quicker.

592
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,160
So you can see very quickly this, this core problem.

593
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,000
And this is the really core problem, which is...

594
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
should be spoken about a million times

595
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,840
more than it is,

596
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,240
which is as inequality gets bigger,

597
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,320
the passive income that

598
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
the rich receive will get bigger.

599
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
The passive income that the poor spend will get bigger,

600
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,400
and the rate of increase of inequality

601
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,200
will increase over time.

602
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
And this will just,

603
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,640
not only will this get worse over time,

604
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,080
it will accelerate in a kind of what

605
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,160
a mathematician would call an exponential fashion. And,

606
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,040
you know, this was all going through my head,

607
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,800
like sitting there on the trading desk.

608
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,880
And of course, I've thought about it

609
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,760
a lot more now, so I can kind of explain it clearly.

610
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,800
What hit me there as a trader was

611
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,680
this gets worse forever.

612
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,480
This gets worse and worse and worse

613
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,640
and worse forever and ever and ever.

614
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,240
And at that time,

615
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,680
the beginning of 2011,

616
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,000
as I explained a little bit earlier,

617
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,840
everybody was like,

618
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,280
this is the year that the recovery really happens.

619
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,000
This is the year that the rates really go.

620
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,560
And I was sitting there

621
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,440
early 2011 saying with everybody saying, this is it,

622
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,280
this is the recovery, this is the recovery.

623
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,760
And I had just become almost certain

624
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
that the economy would collapse forever.

625
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,120
And this might sound callous,

626
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
and I think it's written very well in the book.

627
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,680
I realised,

628
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,000
oh my God, I could make so much f**king money here.

629
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,320
because everyone is wrong and not only that,

630
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,880
they probably won't figure it out for a long time.

631
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,000
They'll be wrong next year

632
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,600
and they’ll be wrong

633
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,240
the year after, and they’ll be wrong the year after.

634
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,480
Because at the time I'd been to LSE, right.

635
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,720
And I,

636
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,160
you know, and I was

637
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,560
after LSE you go into trading

638
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,720
and are surrounded by economists

639
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,960
and the kids that come in on the grad scheme,

640
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,520
they're all of the top graduates

641
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
from all of the top economics

642
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
uni’s across the world, right.

643
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,040
So you're very plugged in to what economists are saying

644
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,480
and what economists are thinking.

645
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,280
You get all of these emails from economists,

646
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,840
you all these economics calls.

647
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,920
So I knew what the economists were thinking.

648
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
Nobody was talking about inequality.

649
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,880
Nobody was talking about inequality at that time.

650
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,240
And I was like, this is why they've been wrong.

651
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,480
This is why, this is why they're consistently wrong.

652
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,440
And I mean, it made sense

653
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,680
because if they are consistently wrong,

654
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,600
which I think was obvious even in 2011,

655
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,680
but should be even more obvious now, it’s

656
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
because they're missing a big thing.

657
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,960
And I've been to universities,

658
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,880
I knew that they weren't looking at this thing

659
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,800
and it had just become...

660
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
the penny had dropped for me.

661
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,480
This was it, this is the big thing.

662
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,120
They're going to miss it.

663
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,360
They're not going to catch it.

664
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,880
And I put this massive trade on that rates

665
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
and stay zero.

666
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,040
I basically made a tonne of money

667
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,840
that year basically betting

668
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,280
that the economy would be a disaster.

669
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,240
And obviously that was one year, 2011.

670
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,080
So you, you’re not...

671
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,280
I was quite confident in that.

672
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,800
I was confident enough to bet a lot on it,

673
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,960
but I wasn't immediately

674
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,280
like 100% certain I was right.

675
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,520
And you can never be 100% certain.

676
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,440
But then you go into the next year

677
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,120
and the same thing happens the next year.

678
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,000
You're like, well,

679
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
everybody’s saying there’s going to be recovery,

680
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,560
and you're saying there’s not going to be a recovery

681
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,040
because the inequality is getting worse.

682
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,800
And then you start to,

683
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,320
you start to think about other things.

684
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,360
You start, for example, I start to think, okay, well,

685
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,520
if there is a big increase in wealth inequality

686
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
that is underlying

687
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,560
the reason that markets are wrong on interest rates

688
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,400
and also the reason why economists

689
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,680
are wrong in their predictions,

690
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,840
maybe the market's wrong on other things.

691
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,800
So I started to think, well,

692
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,160
what would it mean for asset prices more broadly

693
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,440
if inequality would increase?

694
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Well that's quite an easy question right.

695
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,560
Because we know

696
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,240
ordinary people

697
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,040
tend to spend money on goods and services,

698
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,200
rich people tend to spend money buying assets.

699
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,440
So if inequality increases, you would expect to see

700
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,560
asset prices rising while

701
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,000
goods,

702
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,680
services, wages,

703
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
what we call CPI inflation

704
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,560
because CPI doesn't look at assets,

705
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,480
sort of dicks around at the bottom.

706
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,800
And at this time...

707
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,760
and then I was like okay,

708
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,320
well the asset prices are going to go,

709
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
stock market is going to go.

710
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,240
And that again

711
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,760
people...

712
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,440
the economy was so weak in 2011,

713
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,800
we had this big sovereign debt crisis

714
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,200
and we had more austerity.

715
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,920
The economy was so weak.

716
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,720
Everyone was like, stock market is going to be s**t.

717
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,640
But I was like, no,

718
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,680
if I'm right on this,

719
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,280
stock markets will go, because the economy being s**t

720
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,120
if the...

721
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,960
if the economy is s**t because governments are in debt

722
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
well who are they in debt to?

723
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,560
That again itself is a manifestation of inequality, right.

724
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,640
So I said, stock prices will go up. And then they did.

725
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,240
And I said,

726
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,480
well you'll get asset price inflation combined with

727
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,960
disinflation for the poor. And it did.

728
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,160
And what you start seeing is this,

729
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,400
this understanding of inequality,

730
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
it seems to explain all of the incorrect predictions.

731
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,920
And then you start being able

732
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,280
to predict everything correctly.

733
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
And I think that is the big giveaway.

734
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,200
I think when you understand...

735
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,360
you know,

736
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I think it would be easy to turn around and say,

737
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,520
oh, you're just mad. You know, you're just pessimistic.

738
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,880
If I'm pessimistic, why do the bets keep being right?

739
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,800
You know, if this is just pessimism,

740
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,120
why do the bets keep being right?

741
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,640
And, you know, I consistently made money betting on

742
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,960
the economy staying weak.

743
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,120
Markets continue to predict

744
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,760
interest rate normalisation way beyond that.

745
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:50,240
2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019.

746
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,080
Rates in this country stayed zero,

747
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,640
and there would be a few times

748
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,640
you would see rates pop up and the predictions pop up.

749
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
And I would just go back in and bet,

750
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,160
because I knew you can't,

751
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,400
if you don't fix this fundamental problem,

752
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,680
you're not going be able to fix the economy.

753
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,480
And this simple way of understanding it, which is that

754
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,760
the growth in wealth inequality,

755
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,960
not income inequality, wealth inequality

756
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,200
is being missed.

757
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,520
And you start being able to

758
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,120
predict everything correctly.

759
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,280
This one simple idea

760
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,320
that inequality is at the center,

761
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,920
that it is driving living standards

762
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,200
down, has enabled me to correctly predict

763
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,240
the weak recovery from 2008.

764
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
The cost of living crisis during Covid.

765
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,880
Stock price rally in the mid 2010s.

766
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,480
Stock price rally after Covid.

767
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,040
Collapse in living standards.

768
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,760
The collapse of central political parties.

769
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,000
The rise of the far right.

770
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,920
Like I'm not Mystic Meg here. The theories right?

771
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,880
The theory is right

772
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,360
and it's not being looked at.

773
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,160
And if we don't take action on it,

774
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,040
it will get worse and worse and worse and worse.

775
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,280
So that's it, I think that is why

776
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,520
inequality is the core central problem.

777
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,360
I would encourage people to care about it

778
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,920
because if you don't take action on it,

779
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,880
it means living standards

780
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,360
getting worse and worse and worse.

781
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,760
And we will talk in our next video

782
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,880
about how do we fix it.

783
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,080
So thank you very much.

784
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,240
