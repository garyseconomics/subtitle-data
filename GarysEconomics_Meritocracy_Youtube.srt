1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
Today we are going to talk about meritocracy.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,600
Okay.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,560
So today

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,760
we're gonna respond

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,320
to one of the biggest criticisms

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,840
we get for our campaign to tax wealth more,

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,000
which is that's not fair.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,560
That's not meritocratic.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,440
You want to go after people who've worked really hard

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,320
their whole lives to make money,

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,040
and you want to tax them more.

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,040
That's not capitalism, that's not meritocracy.

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,680
So we're going to address this head on.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
First things first,

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,040
I've said it a million times on the channel.

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll say it again.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We are not campaigning to tax working people.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,840
We are campaigning to tax

20
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,160
individuals and families who have hoarded

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,560
enormous amounts of wealth, £10 million or more.

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,600
Secondly, let's talk about meritocracy in society

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,920
that we live in today.

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,280
So I am talking to you here from London.

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
I grew up in East London in quite a poor community.

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,280
I went to a grammar school,

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,440
so I know some richer people.

28
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,360
And then I went to a very fancy university.

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,040
So I know some much richer people.

30
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,880
And then I work in the City,

31
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,240
so I know so much richer people still,

32
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,920
most of my friends from poorer

33
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,640
backgrounds are working really, really hard.

34
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,160
I know a few of them who are earning

35
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,000
much, much higher than average salary.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
They went to some of the top

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,800
universities in the country.

38
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,120
They're making 60, 70, 80 grand a year.

39
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,520
They're sleeping on their mum's sofas,

40
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,240
and they're saving up every single penny

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,960
they can to buy a house.

42
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,160
And they can't buy a house because house prices

43
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,320
go up faster than their savings.

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
At the same time,

45
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,240
I know people from richer families who don't work,

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
who own houses

47
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,720
because their parents gave them £700 grand tax free.

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
Is that meritocracy?

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
This is a question I want to ask you.

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,160
Let's look at what's happening

51
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,880
in our society at the moment.

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,680
House prices are rising very, very, very, very quickly.

53
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
if you've been watching this channel for a long time,

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,160
you’ll know I'm a firm believer

55
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,840
that wealth inequality drives asset prices up.

56
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,080
If you don't understand why that is, I would recommend

57
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,200
that you watch our recent video, part

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
two of our online course,

59
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,800
What is wealth inequality

60
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,040
and how does it affect the economy?

61
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,000
If you give all the money to rich people,

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
they will try and buy all the assets

63
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
and that will drive asset prices up.

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
What that means is ordinary

65
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,880
people can no longer afford assets.

66
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,920
We increasingly live in a society

67
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,880
where whether you are able

68
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,600
to have things like a comfortable family

69
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,280
or have things like home ownership

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
are basically nothing to do with how smart you are,

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,240
how hard you work, what job you have,

72
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,640
what university you went to

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
and are increasingly just a faction

74
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,280
of how rich your parents are.

75
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Listen, we do not live in a meritocracy.

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,320
Nothing could be more obvious.

77
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,680
I think one problem we have is that...

78
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,000
So I'm 37, and my parents

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,120
generation lived in a much less unequal

80
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,000
and much more meritocratic society.

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,880
They lived in a world

82
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,520
where if you worked hard, you could save up some money,

83
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,480
you could buy property,

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,920
and you could reach some level of wealth.

85
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,280
That is not really true anymore.

86
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,320
Younger people are increasingly seeing that it's

87
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,720
basically impossible to get rich

88
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,240
unless you are from money.

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,880
Listen,

90
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,840
wealth exists in our society,

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,320
and there are basically two ways

92
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,520
in which wealth can be distributed.

93
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,560
One is through work.

94
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,440
People who do more valuable work, more high paid work

95
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
get the assets, they get the wealth,

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,120
and they become rich.

97
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,680
The other is basically through aristocracy

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,640
and inheritance, where people who are born

99
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,800
which die rich, and people who are born poor, die poor.

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
We can't really exist in a system where ordinary,

101
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,960
hardworking people from poor families like myself

102
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,640
pay 50 or 60% tax if they make money.

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,840
People from extremely wealthy families,

104
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
like the Duke of Westminster,

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,800
can inherit billions of pounds and pay nothing.

106
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,000
This is not a meritocracy.

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,360
I'm pushing for a meritocratic society.

108
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,960
What I want is an economy

109
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,880
where very rich people pay

110
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
their fair share of tax

111
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,200
instead of all of the tax burden

112
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,680
landing on ordinary working

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
people like you or your kids.

114
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,480
I want a meritocracy.

115
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,200
I want people who work hard to make money.

116
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,400
Unequal societies are not meritocracy.

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,880
They are societies in which people from rich families

118
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,200
get all the assets.

119
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,960
If you want meritocracy,

120
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,280
you should tax the rich rather than working people.

121
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,560
So that's my answer. How do you get meritocracy?

122
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,720
You tax the rich.

123
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,320
That way

124
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,640
we can get the assets to ordinary working people

125
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,800
rather than just the people with rich dads.

126
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,200
That is a meritocratic society.

127
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,600
Support us, support the channel. Thank you very much.
