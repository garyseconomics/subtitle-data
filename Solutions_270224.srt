1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
So we get a lot of comments

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,040
saying, oh yeah, it's all well

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,480
and good, you identified the problem,

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,200
but how do we fix it? How do we fix it?

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,680
Understandable frustration

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,320
because things are bad, things are getting worse,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,600
and I make that very clear.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,120
But I guess people would suggest, like,

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,440
how does that help? Unless you have a solution.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,560
So I wanted to do a video where we basically, sort of,

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,720
talk about that and talk about what the solution is.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,280
And for me,

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,040
whenever I hear people say, what are the solutions,

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,880
I always hear

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,800
in my head two separate questions.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,520
So, I mean, the first thing is,

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,360
if you want a solution,

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,600
you do need to understand the problem.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,080
And I have a very, very clear understanding of,

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,120
in my opinion, what the problem is,

21
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,280
which is that we have a growing wealth inequality.

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,160
If you want to make things better,

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,400
you have to bring that wealth inequality down.

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,720
If you want to stop things getting worse,

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,240
you at least have to stop it from increasing.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,200
It's increasing at the moment very quickly.

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,280
This is what we talk about all the time,

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,360
it's up to people whether they agree with me on that.

29
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,280
Once you accept that, then how do you fix it?

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,120
And I always hear two questions there,

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,480
which is, number one,

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,800
technically, how do you reduce wealth inequality

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,720
or at least how do you stop it from increasing?

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,600
And number two,

35
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,360
how do you build the popular support for it?

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,000
I think these are basically,

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,760
these are the two battles which you have to win.

38
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,160
You have to win both.

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,520
There's no point winning one without the other.

40
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,080
You know, if you work out the taxes

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
but people don't support, you won't get the tax.

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,800
If you get people to support it but you then, you

43
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,640
then apply the tax badly, you’ll f*ck things up.

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,840
So you need to win both of those battles.

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,080
And I think

46
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,720
the first thing which I want people to understand is

47
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,920
we are not going to win this soon.

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,120
This is like number one thing

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,440
which you have to realise.

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,840
We are not going to...

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,040
at the moment wealth inequality

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960
is increasing really quickly.

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,200
Living standards are falling quite quickly.

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,280
That will continue,

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,720
you know, I'd be very surprised

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,800
if we got any improvement on that

57
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,960
in at least a couple of years.

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,000
So, number one, like, sit with that for a bit

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,160
because that's something to deal with.

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
Like, that is something that you need to recognise.

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,440
Like, if you are hoping for better soon,

62
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,080
you're not going to get better soon.

63
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,840
And that is like a really depressing message to give.

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,440
But it's better to know that now

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,320
than to sit around hoping for improvement

66
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,640
that doesn't come.

67
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,480
So number one, except that, once you've accepted that,

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
then the next thing that you should accept after that,

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,360
is that if we want to,

70
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
if we want improvement, we

71
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,600
have to win the long term battle

72
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,840
because we're not going to win the short term battle.

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,720
We lost the short term battle.

74
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,440
We have to win the long term battle.

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,240
And that is why everything that I do

76
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,680
is focused on winning the long term battle.

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,160
Which is,

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
let me flip it

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,720
to a more positive way of looking at it,

80
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,520
which I think is true.

81
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,120
The opportunity here

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,520
to win the kind of

83
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,360
ideological theoretical debate

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,520
has never been bigger because

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,560
the percentage of people

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,280
in this country

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,200
and throughout the West

88
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,320
are being really hurt by the economic changes

89
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,120
now is bigger than it has been

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,200
for, since before the Second World

91
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,920
War, basically an enormous amount.

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,240
The current system is not working

93
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
for an enormous number of people

94
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
and that percentage of people is increasing.

95
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,360
Now, if you go back and you look at

96
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,880
the 2010, 2015 austerity period of the 2010s, basically

97
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,240
austerity decade in this country,

98
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,000
the pain was really loaded on like the bottom 20%.

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
And a lot of people will have felt a bit of pain.

100
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,440
But the pain was really loaded on the poorest.

101
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,960
And from the perspective of a democracy,

102
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,120
it's difficult to stop that

103
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,400
because the poorest are a minority

104
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,160
and it's hard for them to defend themselves.

105
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Whereas now what you have is

106
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,720
50, 60, 70,

107
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,680
you know, pushing up to 80% of people getting hit.

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
That won't change.

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,880
That's going to keep happening.

110
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,080
So you have a massive opportunity here

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,160
to create this

112
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,440
broad political coalition of

113
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,240
people that are getting hurt.

114
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,720
So we have a massive opportunity

115
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,120
and not only that, it is definitely becoming

116
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
increasingly clear

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
to an increasingly large number of people

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,680
that the status quo is not working.

119
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,320
And there's really demand for an alternative.

120
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,240
And I don't think there are many

121
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,680
appealing alternatives being pushed.

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
And the ones that are being pushed,

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
I think are unlikely to work.

124
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,680
So the gap which we can fill has never been bigger.

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,760
There's a real big space

126
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,680
to bring a lot of people together to change the system,

127
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
which is increasingly

128
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,200
clearly not working for a large number of people.

129
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,440
But we're a long way from reaching them.

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,760
So

131
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,040
I think, I’m me, I’m one person.

132
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,440
And I think the biggest thing that I can do is to

133
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,760
grow this voice as

134
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,480
possible and I think, as big as possible.

135
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,640
But I think it needs to be really

136
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,680
clearly focused on

137
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,720
building this really clear narrative

138
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,240
that the reason things are getting worse

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,640
is because wealth inequality is getting worse.

140
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,640
And the only way to make things better

141
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,200
is to make wealth inequality better.

142
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
And the strength

143
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,320
that we will always have with that argument

144
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,280
is that it's correct,

145
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,160
which means that time will continually prove it

146
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,440
correct in the sense that,

147
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,760
you know,

148
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,240
Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are going to go on TV.

149
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,040
They're going to get voted out.

150
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,080
But, you know, Labour will come in

151
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,400
and they will say,

152
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,480
we're going to do the things,

153
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm going to fix the economy,

154
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,680
we're going to make the economy better,

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,200
but they won't fix wealth inequality.

156
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,240
And I'll come out in this channel and I will say,

157
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,640
well, Labour will make all these promises,

158
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,760
but they're not going to make the economy better

159
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
because they're not victims of inequality.

160
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
And I will be right

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,560
and I will make a lot of clear predictions

162
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,000
about how that will manifest.

163
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Rising house prices, decreased home

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,280
ownership, increased levels of debt,

165
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,560
decrease living conditions,

166
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,920
And I will be the one who is right.

167
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,280
My predictions will be right

168
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,640
and this will keep happening.

169
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,720
So I think the power that we have behind this voice

170
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
is that it's correct,

171
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,400
whereas the mainstream politicians will continually

172
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,640
sell tales of improvement, which won't happen.

173
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,560
We will be out saying, no, things will get worse.

174
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,240
You know,

175
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,000
you can go back and look at our videos from June 2020.

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
You know what I'm predicting

177
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,320
there's going to be an inflation

178
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
crisis, there’s going to be a cost of living

179
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
crisis, there's going to be like a massive

180
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
collapse in living standards in this country.

181
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,560
And that's all proved right.

182
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,320
You know, the longer we keep making this channel,

183
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,840
the longer we have this long

184
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,080
track record of

185
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,800
of being correct when everyone else is being wrong.

186
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,240
And I think that gives us this really

187
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,080
powerful opportunity to build a big message.

188
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,280
And I think there will be people out there

189
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,480
that would say, you know, well,

190
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,360
we don't

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
you know, we don't want to support your channel, Gary,

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,640
we don't want this to be like, you know,

193
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,000
you're not going to just be some saviour

194
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,720
that saves the world.

195
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,200
And I 100% agree with that message

196
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,240
because I don't want it to be just me, you know.

197
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,920
And it won't and we won't win if it's just me.

198
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Like what I see myself as doing is

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,320
helping people to understand what's happening.

200
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
And then you go take the understanding

201
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,480
and you build your message.

202
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,880
This is the way like,

203
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,560
of course I'm trying to grow my message,

204
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
but we don't win by making this YouTube

205
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,480
channel have a million subs,

206
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,400
you know what I mean, it's no good.

207
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
We're not going to win.

208
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
It would be great if we had millions subs,

209
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
and I think we will get there one day, but

210
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
we won't win.

211
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,720
We will win

212
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,640
if my YouTube channel has a million subs

213
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,920
and f*cking his does, and his does, and his does,

214
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,840
and you know, not just on YouTube, you’re

215
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
spreading your message in whatever way you can,

216
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
you know what I mean, and that's like,

217
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,040
you know

218
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,000
if you can build a big voice for yourself great

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,920
but you don't need to

220
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,520
you know

221
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,320
if enough people spread this message

222
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,200
within their communities, that would be enough.

223
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,520
You know, their friends, their family,

224
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
the people they go to football with, their workmates.

225
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,880
You know, this...

226
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,640
I don't see this is as about being me...

227
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,040
I don't want this to be about me.

228
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,400
I want this to be about one clear, true idea,

229
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,040
which is you cannot make this better

230
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,360
unless you deal with this problem,

231
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
this problem of wealth inequality.

232
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,640
And, you know, I look at the way that,

233
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,440
you know, Nigel Farage

234
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,840
created a country where, you know, 60% of people

235
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,520
demanded Brexit and he f*cking got his Brexit.

236
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,320
You know,

237
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,480
for better or worse he got it, you know,

238
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
and you know that

239
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
as everybody is seeing

240
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,840
and I think people continue to see did not

241
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,640
and will not fix our economic problems,

242
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,200
we need to make this happen for wealth inequality.

243
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,040
We need to create a country where it becomes

244
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,120
common knowledge, just general common sense.

245
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
If you don't fix wealth inequality,

246
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,920
don't fix the problem.

247
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,800
And then then people like me

248
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,680
and hopefully other people who will adopt the message.

249
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,520
We can hold the politicians feet to the fire

250
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,400
and we can say, no, you know,

251
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
the people demand this thing

252
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,120
and they will not vote for you

253
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,720
unless you give them this thing in the same way

254
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,560
that Nigel Farage did. So,

255
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
you know,

256
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,680
this is not a message

257
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,960
that rich people want you to hear.

258
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,600
So, you know,

259
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,800
we will always get kickback from

260
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,760
billionaire funded think tanks, billionaire owned

261
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,560
newspapers, billionaire owned radio stations.

262
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,960
And that will always be what we fight against.

263
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,880
But what we have, what they don't is that

264
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,000
this is correct and the predictions will be right.

265
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
And I'll keep making right predictions

266
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,120
even if they're horrible predictions.

267
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,440
And, you know, that's the way I see it.

268
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,080
And, you know,

269
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
I focus on that because that's what I can do.

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,840
But I think people watching

271
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,360
who are demanding solutions,

272
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,320
I think they have a choice to make, you know, which is,

273
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
number one, do you support

274
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,880
people like me who would do what we're doing?

275
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
And number two, do you create your own things?

276
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,960
You know, do you spread the message in your own space?

277
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,160
You know,

278
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,680
whether that means, you know,

279
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,760
creating your own forms of communication

280
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,120
or whether that means spreading amongst your community.

281
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
And

282
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,880
the last thing I want to

283
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,760
add on this topic of solutions

284
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,720
is that I think if you've accepted

285
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,760
that it's a long term battle,

286
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,040
then I think the other thing

287
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,360
which is really important is like the...

288
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,480
as much as possible,

289
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,960
how do we maintain our mental health

290
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,360
and our mental health as communities basically?

291
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Because we're going to head into some really,

292
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,880
really, really difficult times

293
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,840
and there's going to be a lot of

294
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
like super divisive narratives going around about

295
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
and increasingly

296
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,080
young people are going to be forced

297
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
to live lives of poverty.

298
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,640
And that is going to be hard.

299
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,120
And I see the damage

300
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
it does to the mental health of young people who

301
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,120
are being driven into poverty,

302
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,480
really through no fault of their own,

303
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,040
through a collapsing economy.

304
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,840
And what I want young people to understand is that

305
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
the economy is changing in such a way

306
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,960
that poverty is being forced on more and more people.

307
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,920
So I know this is not...

308
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,480
this is easier said than done,

309
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,520
but I think that we

310
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,560
all have to be gentle with ourselves and one another.

311
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,800
And the way that we judge one

312
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,520
another's financial positions,

313
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,600
because we've been kind of trained with this idea

314
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,120
that if you're rich

315
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,800
it’s because you're great

316
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,480
and if you're poor, it's

317
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,720
because you're f*cking dumb or something, you know,

318
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,800
and when you give people that message

319
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,400
in a world that gives people no chance

320
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,640
but to be poor, it's

321
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
unbelievably damaging to people’s self-esteem.

322
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,040
And, you know, we're not going to win this fight

323
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,240
with a bunch of people

324
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,640
who have been trained to believe that

325
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,320
they're useless and that their failures,

326
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,040
they're pathetic, you know?

327
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,920
So we need to realise

328
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
there's a systemic problem

329
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,560
that is that is f*cking our young people.

330
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,080
And that means that they will be poor

331
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,600
and it's not their fault.

332
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,280
So, you know,

333
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
if you're out there and you’re struggle

334
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
and you're seeing other people

335
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,280
who are doing better than you,

336
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,800
the truth is probably because of the family

337
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,400
they're from, the family assets that they hold.

338
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,240
Don't beat yourself up on this.

339
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
But at the same time, people

340
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
need to understand that it's going to be hard

341
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,280
and you're going to have to work hard

342
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,480
in many cases to support yourself,

343
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,040
to support your family.

344
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,640
But just like

345
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,840
I spoke before about

346
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,320
we only win this if we win the technical battle

347
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,520
and the ideological battle,

348
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,200
individual people will only be able

349
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
to secure their futures

350
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,280
if they win their personal battles

351
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,320
as well as the political battle.

352
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,040
Because

353
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,920
it doesn't matter how

354
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,960
well I do out here with the politicians, you know,

355
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
you need to feed your kids.

356
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,440
So if that means you work hard

357
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,600
and you don’t have time to support

358
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,320
anything we do politically, then that’s you.

359
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,960
I would never judge anyone in that position.

360
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,760
But if you work hard

361
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,360
and do everything you can

362
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,080
to support your kids

363
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,120
but the economy collapses, which it will,

364
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,280
then you know it's going to hit your family as well,

365
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,400
you know.

366
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,920
You know,

367
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,840
sometimes your boat can sink in two ways

368
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,800
and you need to plug a few holes and

369
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
I think that...

370
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,240
We will win as a country and as a society

371
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,720
if enough of us are able to

372
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,240
fight both our personal battles

373
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,800
and our collective political battle at the same time.

374
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,280
And I'm well aware that that's much easier for me

375
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,720
who does not have the financial difficulties

376
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,960
that people, other people have.

377
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,520
And for that reason, I will try my best

378
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
to take more than my share of the load.

379
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,320
But it will be about whether enough of us can, can

380
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
come in and support it.

381
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,480
And, you know, hopefully we'll see this thing grow

382
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,400
and then I'll start to get,

383
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,480
I'll start to get some the politicians

384
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
and we can start having more discussions

385
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
about the technicalities

386
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,320
of what kind of taxes you bring in.

387
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
But now is not the time for that

388
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
because we're losing the ideological battle.

389
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,400
And, you know, and,

390
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,960
you know, bad things can happen if we don't win that.

391
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,320
So I'm going to focus on that.

392
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,640
I would like to thank everybody for their support.

393
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,360
You know, I'm sorry to be always coming in

394
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
with negative messages,

395
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,560
but I think it's better to know

396
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,840
the truth of what's coming than...

397
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,680
than to be living in a bubble of false hope.

398
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,880
You know, this is what we need to do.

399
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,600
It's going to be hard.

400
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,120
But, you know, tough times create strong people.

401
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,760
And, you know, if we get enough strong people,

402
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,640
then I think we can win.

403
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,080
So, yeah, thanks, everyone, for

404
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,480
thank you, everybody for your support

405
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,280
and keep supporting the channel. Thank you.
