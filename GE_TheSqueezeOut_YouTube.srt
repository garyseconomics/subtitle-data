1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
Okay.

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,960
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,320
Today, we are going to explain why

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,640
Labour is crushing your living standards.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:08,760
Okay.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,080
So if you are watching this video on Sunday the

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,240
30th of March, which is when it's gonna go out,

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,120
or shortly afterwards, you will be watching in the

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,080
immediate aftermath of Labour's Spring Statement.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,560
The news will have been absolutely covered in

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,880
discussion of things like fiscal rules and

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,560
government bond rates and forecasts for growth.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,520
And you're probably be expecting that I

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
will do something on the Spring Statement.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
But to be honest, at times like this, when we have

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,760
these kind of theatrical political set plays, I often

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,520
get frustrated with the way the media has a kind of

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,680
a fixation with nailing in on the specific details.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,560
Which tax has he risen?

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,080
or which tax has she risen?

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,520
Which spending has she cut?

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,040
And there's very often very little discussion

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,760
of what is actually happening in the big picture.

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Why is Labour choosing to do austerity 2.0?

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,640
What are the reasons driving basically

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,120
the need for, for Labour to do this?

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,720
Why are they being forced to do this?

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,240
When I was a trader, one of the first

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,000
things which I found really interesting was that

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,600
you very quickly realise as a trader that the

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,120
things which are portrayed as important on the news

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,920
are very often not important for traders at all.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,120
And the things which are important for traders in the

34
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,480
markets are very often not shown in the news at all.

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,080
So you have a situation where the news likes these

36
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,160
kind of set plays, like budgets, spring statements,

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,360
but really what matters for traders, the economy

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,160
for your living standards are what are the

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,440
big picture, long-term changes in the economy?

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,280
So what I want to do today is I want

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
to explain why it is that Labour is

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,400
doing austerity 2.0, why Labour is cutting spending,

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,200
cutting benefits, raising taxes on workers.

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Why is Labour crushing your living standards?

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,200
So I was very pessimistic about

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Labour before the election.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,680
I was very confident that they would basically

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,960
fail to significantly grow the economy, that

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,240
they would preside over falling living standards.

50
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,720
And I thought there was always a

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,080
significant risk that they would basically

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,800
move into this austerity 2.0 space.

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,200
And, the reason for this is because I understood

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,880
the big picture trend which has dominated the

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,280
economy really for the last 20 years, really,

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,960
but especially since, for the last five years,

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,280
since COVID, which I am calling the squeeze out.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,480
The squeeze out of the working class, the squeeze out

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,600
of the middle class, the squeeze out of the government.

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,360
And in this video, we're going to go

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,920
through nice and slowly, in detail what

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,320
the squeeze out is and how it affects you.

63
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,640
Okay.

64
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,920
So the squeeze out really is kind of a

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,760
new way of framing something that I've

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,240
been speaking about for a long time.

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,840
But I've been really moving

68
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
towards this kind of framing recently.

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,600
And I think it's a really powerful way

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,720
to explain to ordinary people what's

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,640
happening and how it affects them.

72
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,280
So on this channel, I speak a

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
lot about wealth inequality.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,360
But I think wealth inequality,

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
as a concept, can sound a little bit academic.

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
It can sound a little bit idealistic, egalitarian.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,640
People can kind of think this is politics

78
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,880
of envy, how does that affect me?

79
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,440
And I think the squeeze out is a focus on really the

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,840
most damaging and most dangerous direct consequence

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,640
of wealth inequality for ordinary people, which is

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,800
that the rich accumulate an enormous amount of money.

83
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,640
And they use that to out-compete other

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,800
groups in society, such as the working

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,920
class and the middle class, for assets.

86
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,480
Meaning that over time, the working class and the

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,760
middle class have less and less and less assets,

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
and go further and further and further into debt.

89
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
And to be honest, it was an understanding of

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,440
this phenomenon which actually led me to become

91
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,400
interested in wealth inequality in the first place.

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
When I was a trader in the aftermath of 2008,

93
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,760
everybody was predicting a strong economic recovery.

94
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,200
But I couldn't help but notice that ordinary families

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,640
were getting poorer and poorer year after year,

96
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,840
generation after generation, and so were the government.

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
And this was basically what led me to

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,600
understanding that inequality is important.

99
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,200
So if we reframe and focus instead of wealth inequality

100
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,240
itself and on the squeezing out of the working class

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
and the middle class, I think it makes it a lot more

102
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,240
visceral and powerful for ordinary people, ordinary

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
families like you, because you start to see what this

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,040
means is me and my family are gonna lose our wealth.

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
We're gonna lose our houses.

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,760
We're gonna get driven into debt.

107
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,840
Okay.

108
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,520
So what I'm gonna do from now is basically a nice

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,400
historical lesson of the history of wealth inequality.

110
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm gonna focus mainly on this country, in the UK.

111
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
And we're gonna talk about how ordinary

112
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,640
families got wealth and how they got

113
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,440
squeezed out and are being squeezed out.

114
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:16,720
Okay.

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,680
So first, some historical context.

116
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,320
The period 70 years after World War

117
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,640
II is not historically normal, and

118
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
it's not internationally normal.

119
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,920
During that period of 70 years, we saw

120
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,320
a lot of ordinary people, a lot of ordinary

121
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
families, people earning average or even

122
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,400
less than average incomes being able to

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,120
own homes without significant debt, get things

124
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,880
like pensions, basically own a chunk of the wealth.

125
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,920
That is not common.

126
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,600
If you go to most of the world, to be honest,

127
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,520
outside Europe and North America, if you go to most

128
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,520
countries in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia,

129
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,960
what you see is small, very wealthy elites and

130
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,280
a very small middle class below that.

131
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,280
And that most people live, don't own significant wealth.

132
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,400
What they own is worth very little

133
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
and they live in poverty.

134
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,080
And that was true in Europe and in

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,800
this country, the UK, and in the United

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,120
States for most of history as well.

137
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,000
And that is basically, to be honest, that is the

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,520
long term history of sort of post-agricultural

139
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
human civilisations, is you tend to have a

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
small elite and a lot of poverty around them.

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,560
In the history of this country, the UK, you do

142
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,000
have sort of a couple of historical examples when

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,160
working people were able to get themself a little

144
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,480
bit more power and a little bit more wealth.

145
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,440
After the plague, after the Black

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,800
Death when 50% of the population of Europe

147
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,120
died, working people were a bit more needed.

148
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,880
They were able to get a little bit more of a share.

149
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,040
You were able to see women get a bit more of a share

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,640
than they did historically at that point in time.

151
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
During the Industrial Revolution, in the Industrial

152
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
Revolution, you had a period where basically

153
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
all of the world's production was happening in,

154
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,440
you know, a small part of Northwestern Europe.

155
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,640
And after a lot of fighting, ordinary working

156
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
people were again able to get a bit of a share.

157
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,120
But even then realistically, these societies

158
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,080
lived in very high levels of inequality, most

159
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,120
of the wealth owned by super elite.

160
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
But in the 20th century, this all changed basically.

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,480
People sometimes forget that even at the

162
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,720
beginning of the 20th century, the 1900s, there

163
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,200
was still really, really widespread poverty and

164
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,920
extreme inequality even in this country, the UK.

165
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,400
My grandmother, who was born in the '20s,

166
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
saw I think three or four of her siblings

167
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,960
die of tuberculosis, which is basically a

168
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
disease, a preventable disease of poverty.

169
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah, people lived in desperate

170
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,320
poverty in the early 20th century.

171
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,840
But during and immediately after World War

172
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,520
II, there was really significant change here.

173
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,800
And what you see if you compare pre-World War II

174
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,920
to post-World War II is suddenly a massive increase

175
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,840
in wealth holding of the government and some of that

176
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,480
wealth being held by the middle class and eventually

177
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,560
even significant amounts of working class wealth.

178
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,240
So I often talk about how my dad worked for the post

179
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,240
office making 20 grand a year, less than average wage.

180
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,920
And, he was able to buy property, things like that.

181
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,880
So what you see is suddenly

182
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,480
this historic wealth dynamic of the rich owning

183
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,680
everything changes in the 20th century.

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,720
And I think that the key to

185
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
that is basically World War II.

186
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,200
And I think World War II sees basically, like,

187
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,520
a big shift in the ownership of wealth.

188
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
And, to be honest, I would like to

189
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,640
understand a little bit more about exactly how

190
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,040
that wealth shifts during World War II from

191
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,360
being owned by the rich, to being owned

192
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
by the government and by ordinary people.

193
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
I've been looking into it.

194
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,880
I've got my theories.

195
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
Probably we'll get an expert in

196
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
to speak about it one day.

197
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,640
I think it's interesting to consider because at the

198
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,560
moment when there is a lot of attention on, can we tax

199
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,440
the rich, people sometimes forget that the 20th century

200
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,960
is a really good example of the fact that wealth can

201
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,360
be redistributed, It doesn't just have to flow one way.

202
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
It can flow back to ordinary people.

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,680
But what you need to know for now

204
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,960
is essentially World War II saw

205
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,360
a really historic shift in who owns the wealth.

206
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,960
And it was no longer owned just by a small elite, and

207
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,760
it was suddenly owned in large part by the government

208
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,040
and by the middle class and by the working class.

209
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,520
And in the period 30, 40 years after World War

210
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,880
II, this kind of stayed relatively unchanged.

211
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,920
And this was largely because in that period, we

212
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,560
had very, very high rates of tax on rich people,

213
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120
which essentially prevented the flow of wealth, which

214
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,800
I talk about a lot on this channel, from happening.

215
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,520
So whenever you have inequality, you have this kind of

216
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,320
problematic, you know, monopoly game style situation,

217
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,080
which is these guys own the assets, these guys don't.

218
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,240
You have to pay your salary to them.

219
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,560
And over time, that wealth

220
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,440
difference grows and grows and grows.

221
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,200
But in the 50s, 60s, 70s, we had very high rates of

222
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,480
tax on the richest, which basically prevented the

223
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,680
rich from accumulating money and buying up the assets.

224
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,880
Then in the 80s, you have the Thatcher in this country,

225
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,480
Reagan in the US governments come in and, basically

226
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,360
totally rewrite the story around economics.

227
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,840
Lots of people don't like Thatcher and Reagan,

228
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,040
but I think when you look back at what they did,

229
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,760
we can kind of view them as a, as a hopeful example that

230
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,600
tax policies can be changed, distributions can be

231
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,880
changed, the story about economics can be changed.

232
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,520
And these guys basically changed the story.

233
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,600
I will add that's what we're

234
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,720
trying to do on this channel, basically,

235
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,240
change the story about economics.

236
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,720
Thatcher and Reagan came in, they changed

237
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,160
the story on economics, and they massively,

238
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,840
massively slashed taxation on the richest people.

239
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,800
And as soon as you do that, that's

240
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,960
when the squeeze out begins.

241
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,640
And we enter stage one of the squeeze out.

242
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,160
Okay, so part one of the squeeze out, taxes

243
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,600
have been cut on rich people in the 80s.

244
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
And suddenly, rich people start

245
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,760
to accumulate a lot of money.

246
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,440
Now, one key feature of rich people, which I speak about

247
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,600
a lot on the channel, is that rich people have what

248
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,720
economists call a low marginal propensity to consume.

249
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,200
What that means is if you give rich

250
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
people a lot of money, they will not

251
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
increase their consumption significantly.

252
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,080
What they will do instead is they will

253
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,480
start to buy significantly assets.

254
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,280
So the rich get lot of money, they start buying assets.

255
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,480
The first thing you see is asset prices rising.

256
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,360
You start to see stock markets... you

257
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,480
start to see stock markets going up, and

258
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,520
you start to see house prices going up.

259
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,960
What's interesting about this is most people

260
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,800
perceive this stage one as a really good thing.

261
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,480
So, you know, we're existing in this post-war economy

262
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,160
where lots of people, even poorer people own assets, and

263
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,280
they start to see their house price go up, or they start

264
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,480
to see their stock holdings go up if you're in a country

265
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,240
where, like the US or Germany where people own stocks.

266
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,400
People are really excited, like, "My house

267
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,480
price is going up, stock price is going up.

268
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,760
Like, this is really, really good."

269
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,720
And I think what people don't realise is those

270
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,880
rising stock prices and those rising house

271
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,680
prices are basically a manifestation of the rich

272
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,840
starting to squeeze people out of asset holding.

273
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,520
And, what you will see first is the

274
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,880
very poorest people will respond to these

275
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,400
increased asset prices by selling their assets.

276
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,080
And I think the first thing that you saw was,

277
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,640
in particular, older people from poorer families

278
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,880
using that, I suppose, asset windfall to

279
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,160
give themselves more comfortable retirements.

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,760
I want to point out, comfortable retirements are not

281
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,240
a historical or an international norm, but

282
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,200
this is a thing which we started to get in

283
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,440
particular in this first stage of the squeeze out.

284
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,360
So if you're... if you're poor, you've lived a

285
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
poor life and suddenly you see your house price

286
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,680
going up, what you are probably gonna do is

287
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,200
you're gonna say, "Okay, this is great.

288
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,120
I'm gonna use that increased price to give myself

289
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,800
a little bit of luxury, and a little bit of comfort

290
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,120
in my retirement." And what this means is the

291
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,560
first stage of the squeeze out, it feels great

292
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
even for the poor, especially if you own property.

293
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,840
You're like, "My asset price is going up,

294
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm gonna sell the asset and I'm going

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,760
to live a better life." So what we see is

296
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,800
in the first stage, the rich are accumulating

297
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,440
money, but they are not using that to out-compete

298
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,760
the poor or the middle class for consumption, which

299
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
means living standards don't fall for ordinary people.

300
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,200
What they are doing is they're using it

301
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,280
to squeeze the weakest hands, which is the

302
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,240
historical working class, out of ownership

303
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,960
of assets, out of ownership of property.

304
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,560
Now, that goes on and on, and eventually you start

305
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,160
to see property prices are going up and up and up.

306
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,480
Poorer families eventually over time are

307
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,600
owning less and less housing.

308
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,920
I think a really good example of this is, the

309
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,080
Right to Buy scheme here in the UK, which is when

310
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,320
the UK government sold off its housing to poorer people,

311
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
and those poorer people owned their houses for

312
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
a bit, eventually sold them in order to fund

313
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,280
decent retirements and ended up owning nothing.

314
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,920
Now, the properties are owned by rich people

315
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,720
and they're buy to let properties, and the

316
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,960
poor end up with the government having no

317
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,000
assets and themselves having no assets.

318
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,240
This is a really, really good example of how

319
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,840
in stage one of the squeeze out asset prices

320
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,720
get pushed up and up and up and up and up, and

321
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,560
that squeezes out the weakest hands in society

322
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,760
who are in the first place, the working class.

323
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
But the working class often, and this is not

324
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,280
just the working class, the squeezed out class

325
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,200
often enjoys it because they are able to consume

326
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,840
more while they are dis-saving their wealth.

327
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,440
And they often don't look down the line and

328
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,080
think, "What's gonna happen when we don't

329
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,800
have any wealth left?" So what you see here is

330
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,080
weaker and weaker hands dis-saving their assets,

331
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,560
getting poorer and poorer in wealth terms, but

332
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,720
using that to sustain a good quality of life.

333
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,960
And I think I'll just make it clear what dis-saving is.

334
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,480
Dis-saving is I have some wealth

335
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,800
and I'm gonna, for a period of time, spend more

336
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
than my income by basically selling the wealth

337
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,680
that I have to the rich or by taking on debt.

338
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,880
So dis-saving is... dis-saving is really a key

339
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,600
concept to understanding the squeeze out, which

340
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,040
is, I have some assets, over time I sell them

341
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
to the rich, and that enables me to live a good

342
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,840
quality of life while I'm being squeezed out.

343
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,520
So you kind of have people cheering

344
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,480
on their own demise in a sense.

345
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
But over time, less and less

346
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,520
and less poor people own homes.

347
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,480
The asset price goes up and up.

348
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,960
Rich people are accumulating more

349
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,920
wealth and accumulating more money.

350
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,720
And you reach a situation where the only

351
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,160
way for especially the working class,

352
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,320
but also often the middle class, to own

353
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,120
homes, to compete with the rich for ownership

354
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,400
of homes, is to borrow the money from the rich.

355
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,280
So you're seeing less ownership of property and

356
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,680
increasing levels of debt, increasing size of mortgages.

357
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,640
And this keeps happening.

358
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,320
The rich get richer and richer and richer,

359
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,400
house prices go up and up and up and up, levels

360
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,720
of debt increase and increase and increase.

361
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,200
And eventually you reach a point where the rich are

362
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,800
looking at the poor and the middle class and they're

363
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,880
saying, "Well, you don't have any assets anymore.

364
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,360
You are in a massive amount of debt to us.

365
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,760
We don't think you are creditworthy anymore." And

366
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,520
that is when you enter stage two of the squeeze out.

367
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,200
So when we get to stage two, you have

368
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,320
this problem where basically a big chunk

369
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,400
of society can't borrow money anymore.

370
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,360
And this happens in 2008.

371
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,640
So up until 2008, a big chunk of society is

372
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,280
getting squeezed out, but they're able to still

373
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,080
spend because the rich are lending to them.

374
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,360
They basically reach a point where the

375
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,600
rich says, "They're no longer in good credit.

376
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's stop lending to them." And that

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
is when you enter an economic crisis.

378
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Suddenly the lending is not there.

379
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,680
This means a massive chunk of society can't afford to

380
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,480
spend and you essentially enter an economic depression.

381
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,840
People can't spend, businesses shut down.

382
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,400
That means even more people can't spend.

383
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,760
And that is for the first point in the squeeze out

384
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,440
when the rich are not only taking your assets, but

385
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,240
they start to basically not allow you to consume.

386
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,880
And what this of course means is

387
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,960
there's a massive increase in poverty.

388
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,440
Suddenly people lose their job, people

389
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,760
can't borrow, people can't spend, there's

390
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,600
a massive economic depression, and that

391
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,160
means that governments have to step in.

392
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,120
So here in Western Europe, we generally live in

393
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,680
welfare states where the governments have a kind

394
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,640
of theoretical responsibility to make sure that the

395
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,600
majority of their populations stay out of poverty.

396
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,080
But the majority of the population

397
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,840
by the beginning of stage two, they've

398
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,960
got no wealth, they've got no power.

399
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,400
They basically have no way to

400
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,080
keep themselves out of poverty.

401
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,920
So governments step in.

402
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,040
But the government has a problem, which is the rich

403
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,560
are getting richer and richer and richer and richer.

404
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,960
They have the assets.

405
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,200
This group of people, the working

406
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,520
class, they've got nothing.

407
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,960
The government needs the assets from

408
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,040
the rich to support the working class.

409
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,760
But unfortunately, the government has been very

410
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,920
reluctant to tax the rich, so they turn around to

411
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,680
the rich and they say, "What do you want in order

412
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,520
for you to allow the poor to, to live, to have a good

413
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,880
quality of life?" And the rich basically say to the

414
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,760
government the same thing that they said to the poor,

415
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,200
which was, "We want your assets and we'll

416
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,680
lend you the money." And then, then you see basically

417
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,400
the exact same thing happening to government, which

418
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,680
happened to the poor in stage one, which is the

419
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,800
rich... The government gradually sells off its

420
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,400
assets, sells off its assets, sells off its assets.

421
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,560
Government dis-saving essentially.

422
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,480
Asset prices start to go up again because the

423
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,840
rich are getting richer and richer and richer.

424
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,880
And I think it's worth noting that after 2008, even

425
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,960
though the initial move was a crash in asset prices,

426
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,480
there was then a massive increase in asset prices.

427
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,560
The government are put in the same

428
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,360
situation that the working class were in.

429
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,200
The only way they can support living standards for the

430
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,320
working class is to sell their assets and to take debt.

431
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,000
And the government gets poorer and poorer

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and poorer, fewer and fewer assets, and

433
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,720
more and more and more and more debt.

434
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
And I think we'll try and flash up a graph of Thomas

435
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,120
Piketty's data on the wealth of governments, which

436
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,760
has massively, massively collapsed in the last 20 years.

437
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,040
So what you see on this graph is a graph by the

438
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,720
French economist Thomas Piketty looking at the wealth

439
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,000
levels, total amount of assets versus total amount

440
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,960
of debt of all of the world's biggest governments.

441
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,800
And what you see here is the US and also

442
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,360
European governments, basically their

443
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
wealth has collapsed all the way to zero.

444
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,720
It's worth noting that this graph stops before

445
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,680
COVID, and in COVID, these wealth levels collapsed.

446
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,680
So what you have now is a situation where basically

447
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,240
western governments are not only zero wealth,

448
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,080
they're actually massively in negative wealth.

449
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,560
And this is a perfect example of the government

450
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,280
being squeezed out, just like the poor were.

451
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
So what you have there is basically stage

452
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,360
two and stage three of the squeeze out.

453
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,400
Stage two is the economic depression.

454
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,960
Ordinary people can't spend.

455
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,560
Suddenly there is a collapse in consumption,

456
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,400
a first collapse in living standards.

457
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,880
And stage three is the government stepping in, the

458
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
government supporting living standards, but the

459
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,560
government gradually itself getting squeezed out.

460
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,080
Eventually when the government runs out of

461
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,720
wealth and is too far in debt to borrow any

462
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,240
further, that is when we enter stage four.

463
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
So stage four is basically where we are now.

464
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,040
And I think stage four perfectly explains what is

465
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,840
happening now to the UK government, what increasingly

466
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,000
will happen to the US government, what increasingly

467
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,240
will happen to European governments, which is

468
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,520
the government has tried to step in to protect

469
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,040
the poor who are having their wealth squeezed

470
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,960
out by this rapidly growing wealth of the rich.

471
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,520
And as a result of doing that, they have

472
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,080
had their own wealth squeezed out, and

473
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,200
now they have no wealth left either.

474
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,680
And they are left in a situation where

475
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,920
there's basically nothing they can do.

476
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,520
Well, there is one thing they could do.

477
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,400
They could tax the rich, but whilst that is off

478
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,960
the table, they really simply have no choice

479
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,280
but to shut down the welfare states, because

480
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,720
we are moving back to that pre-World War II

481
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,840
period where all of the wealth, all of the

482
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,600
assets, all of the power are held by the rich.

483
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,560
The working class have nothing left.

484
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,920
The government have nothing left.

485
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,600
They have no wealth in order to provide you with

486
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
the things which they are supposed to provide you.

487
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,960
So what you see and what we have seen in the last 10, 15

488
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,080
years and what we will see more aggressively in the next

489
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,640
10 years is basically the shutting down of government.

490
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,440
So you see the closing of local services, you

491
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,520
see the aggressive contraction of welfare,

492
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,240
you see the defunding of the courts and the

493
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,120
defunding of the police, and eventually the

494
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,240
defunding of things like education and healthcare.

495
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,920
We saw the defunding of social housing a long time ago.

496
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,360
Basically because the government have been

497
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,040
squeezed out, they have no choice but to

498
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,480
basically shut down all of these services.

499
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,200
And I think, I think this is the part of the discussion

500
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,160
which is never really spoken about by economists

501
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,480
and never really spoken about in the media.

502
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,760
I think what you will have seen... And we are shooting

503
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,680
this before the spring statement came out, by the way.

504
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,080
But what you will have seen is the government...

505
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,640
the media talking a lot about fiscal rules without

506
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
really recognising the underlying reality, which is all

507
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,640
of the wealth has gone increasingly to a small elite.

508
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,440
And that means that the government really, if

509
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,800
they're not willing to tax the elite with that

510
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,880
wealth, the only option they have is to try and

511
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,720
squeeze as much as they can the one remaining

512
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,080
section of society which has a bit of wealth and

513
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,440
has a bit of power, which is the middle class.

514
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,400
And that is kind of what the government is doing.

515
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,480
They're trying to fill this middle gap

516
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,760
of, "We're gonna tax the middle class

517
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
because they're the only guys with wealth.

518
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,360
We're gonna try to borrow from the rich." But really

519
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,840
all that does is further squeeze out the next weakest

520
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,240
hand, which is the middle class, and further enrich

521
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,600
the guys who are doing the squeezing, which is the rich.

522
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,040
And then you end up in a situation which

523
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,840
I think increasingly we are coming into

524
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,880
and we will come into, where basically

525
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,720
nobody has any wealth except for the rich.

526
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,080
And then what you start to see is the

527
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,520
physical transformation of society,

528
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,760
which is, we have lived for the last 70 years

529
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,720
in middle class, working class societies.

530
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,440
And what I mean by that is we have lived in societies

531
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,880
which unusually have provided things such as good

532
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,480
quality housing and education and healthcare and goods

533
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,520
and services to the middle class and the working class.

534
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,120
But those guys have no wealth and no power anymore.

535
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,960
So you need to change what you produce, you

536
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,320
need to change the physical shape of your

537
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,360
economy, and you need to stop producing things

538
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,600
for the working class, stop producing things for the

539
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,160
middle class and start producing only for the rich.

540
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,400
And I think a couple good historical examples of

541
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,600
these are the famous potato famine in Ireland where

542
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,880
basically food was being grown in Ireland

543
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,840
and exported to rich people who... while

544
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
the Irish died because they were poor.

545
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I think of the famines in India where people were

546
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
dying in India because the fields were growing

547
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
tea that was being sent halfway across the world.

548
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,960
I think another great

549
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
example of that is, is MrBeast.

550
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,040
MrBeast goes to Africa, he spends $500 to

551
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,240
give a kid their eyesight back forever.

552
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,280
The reason that that kid doesn't have his eyesight is

553
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
because he lives in a very unequal country, he is a

554
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,560
member of the poor class, he does not get anything.

555
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
He's been fully squeezed out.

556
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,920
The resources that he needs to get his eyesight back are

557
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,040
being used by the rich and he can't compete with them.

558
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
So you need to move into a completely transformed

559
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,400
society, which does not produce anything

560
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,800
for the poor or for the middle class.

561
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,760
I think the best example you can see of

562
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,440
that, especially here where I live, is housing.

563
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,440
So I grew up in Ilford, in East London.

564
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,760
It was a, it was a working class street we

565
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,800
grew up in, it was quite a working class town.

566
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,160
lots of small families

567
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,920
living in small terraced houses.

568
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
But it was respectable, it was dignified.

569
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,320
There was a degree of space.

570
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,360
And if you go back to Ilford now, you'll

571
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
see that physical transformation, which is

572
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,800
all of those houses have been expanded up,

573
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,440
they've been expanded back, they're rented

574
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,560
out by the room, quality of life is very low.

575
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,000
It's basically a slum.

576
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,080
There's all of these enormous blocks of tiny,

577
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,040
tiny flats which have very low standard of

578
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,000
living inside them. And what you are seeing

579
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,080
here is the building of the slum.

580
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,560
And if you go into Central London, you will see these

581
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,320
unbelievably luxurious flats being built everywhere.

582
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,280
You will see luxurious restaurants, luxurious

583
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,480
hotels, luxurious bars, absolutely full of

584
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,640
rich people because rich people have taken

585
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
all the wealth, they've squeezed everyone else

586
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,760
out, and they are taking all the resources.

587
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,880
So this is it, really.

588
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,360
This is what is dominating the government situation, which

589
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,000
is not getting spoken about much, which is weak hands

590
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,880
are being progressively squeezed out of our society.

591
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
I think if you're from the working

592
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,880
class, if you're from a poor family,

593
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,760
you've been able to see that for a while.

594
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,160
If you're from a more middle-class situation, you

595
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,640
might not have realised it's starting coming for you.

596
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,480
But this is the way that it goes.

597
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,520
The working class gets squeezed out first, then

598
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
the government gets squeezed out, then the middle

599
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,480
class gets squeezed out, and eventually you move

600
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,880
to this kind of South Africa-style, Brazil-style,

601
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,160
India-style economy where everything is owned

602
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,040
by the rich and no one else has anything left.

603
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,320
This is what is dominating our political narrative.

604
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,800
And unless the government does something

605
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,640
about this squeeze out, there will be

606
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,080
basically nothing that they can do.

607
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,000
And this will simply go further and further.

608
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,560
It will get worse and worse.

609
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,200
I think it's interesting to ask, what do the

610
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,280
rich do once they've squeezed everybody else out?

611
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,360
Because at this point, they will have

612
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,280
enormous amounts of passive income.

613
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,640
There'll be no weak hands to squeeze out of the economy.

614
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,640
The only thing that they can do with their enormous

615
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,000
income, their enormous wealth, their enormous

616
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,080
resources, is try to squeeze out each other.

617
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,320
And historically, that basically means war.

618
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,400
The rich have everything.

619
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,080
They want more.

620
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,280
The only people you can take from are other rich people.

621
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,280
And, you know, this is the history of Europe, you know.

622
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,200
And World War II essentially was the

623
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,320
climax of it, you know, the Holocaust,

624
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,360
the nuclear bombing of Japan.

625
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,480
This basically was the logical endpoint of the continual

626
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,120
squeeze out, which is the rich take more, the rich

627
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,520
take more, the rich take more, the rich takes more.

628
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,200
And eventually, you have nothing, and you're

629
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,080
worthless, and you can be used as a pawn in a war.

630
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,760
But we're not there yet.

631
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,000
What I wanna talk about right now is how this is

632
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,880
relevant to the statement that came out in the

633
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,280
week, which is, the government is essentially

634
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,200
rowing a boat with a massive hole in the bottom.

635
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Your wealth is being squeezed out.

636
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,520
You are losing your power.

637
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,200
The government is losing wealth and power.

638
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,040
The rich are getting richer and

639
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,720
richer and richer every day.

640
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,000
And the reality of that is

641
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,160
you simply have to get poorer.

642
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,440
You are losing your relative position in society.

643
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,800
And until you, the working class, the middle classes

644
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,960
of the UK, the US, and the government are willing

645
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,560
to start putting that in reverse, there simply is

646
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,160
no alternative other than to shut the welfare state

647
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,200
down and to basically drive yourself into poverty.

648
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,720
Okay, so to recap, the squeeze out is why the

649
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,440
government is destroying your living standards.

650
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,720
It's why you and your family and

651
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,520
your kids will be increasingly poor.

652
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
There are five stages of the squeeze out.

653
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,880
Stage one, the rich starts to accumulate money.

654
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,440
They drive asset prices up, and they

655
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,880
out-compete the working class for resources,

656
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,600
and they drive the working class into debt.

657
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,960
Stage two, the working class have run out of resources.

658
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,120
They can no longer borrow anymore.

659
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,520
They can no longer spend anymore.

660
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,880
You get an economic depression and a crisis.

661
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,760
That's when the government has to step in.

662
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,960
Stage three, the government increasingly

663
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,560
runs out of resources as well.

664
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,000
The government too becomes

665
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,600
massively in debt to the rich.

666
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,280
That's when we enter stage four.

667
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,880
The government has no choice but to

668
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,960
slowly eviscerate the middle class.

669
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,920
Eventually, there is no wealth left other

670
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,080
than that held by the rich, and the physical

671
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,560
structure of your society changes such that

672
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,320
it only supports consumption for rich people.

673
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
At this point, almost everybody in the

674
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
country lives in desperate poverty.

675
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,080
Stage five, there are no weak

676
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,760
hands left to be squeezed out.

677
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,000
The rich own everything, and the only way they

678
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,080
can try to grow their wealth is by sending

679
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,600
you to fight in their wars against each other.

680
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,040
So another, characteristically

681
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,840
depressing video from Garys Economics.

682
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,440
Listen, I wanna make it clear.

683
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,080
Your grandparents fought for a better

684
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,280
settlement, and they got a better settlement.

685
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,680
They lived in a world where there was desperate

686
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,160
widespread poverty,

687
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,560
and they fought for

688
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
something better, and they got something better.

689
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,320
They understood the only way

690
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,760
to do that was to tax the rich.

691
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,480
We're campaigning on this

692
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,400
channel to tax wealth, not work.

693
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,680
We are reaching out to the guys at Labour.

694
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,600
We would love them to talk to us about policy.

695
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,720
This will get worse.

696
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,920
Until the government gets serious about taxing

697
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,440
the rich, there's basically nothing they can do.

698
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,440
I'm gonna try to make them serious about it,

699
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,080
and your support is the only power that I have.

700
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,920
So support the channel, share it with your friends,

701
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,840
share with your family, send it to your mum,

702
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,720
send it to Rachel Reeves, maybe she's interested.

703
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,120
If you lose all your wealth, you lose all

704
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,160
your power, and you lose everything else.

705
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,200
Stop the squeeze out.

706
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,320
Take the wealth back.

707
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,240
Tax wealth, not work.

708
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,000
Thank you.
