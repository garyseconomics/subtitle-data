1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Okay.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,600
Welcome back to
Garys Economics.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,520
Today, we are going to
do something different

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,080
and we're going to have
a guest on the channel,

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,920
an economist for
the very first time.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,840
One of my
favorite economists

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,000
working today.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,120
I very often get
asked on this channel,

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,960
where else can we go to
learn about economics?

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,640
What other stuff
can we read?

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,800
How can we learn more?

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
And there are a
lot of economists who

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,080
I like working today.

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,160
There's obviously a
couple of French guys

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
working on inequality-

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,080
Piketty and Zucman.

17
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,080
But the person who I
always recommend, because

18
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,400
I think he is the best at
writing about economics in

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,680
a way that is accessible
and relatable for

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,680
ordinary people is today's
guest on the channel.

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,400
So I'd like to
welcome Ha-Joon Chang.

22
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,040
Thank you.

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,800
Thank you very much

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,440
for coming.

25
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,360
I think I'll just
introduce briefly

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,880
how we met and how
I got to know you.

27
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,240
So, I quit banking
in 2014, and when I

28
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,480
came back, I was sort
of looking about how can

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
I change the economy.

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,600
And I didn't really
know much about

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,080
the work getting done in
economics today, and I got

32
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,440
invited to a small, what
can I say, lecture series

33
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,000
that you were doing?

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,040
Yeah.

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah.

36
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,640
When was it?

37
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,160
Was it 2015, perhaps?

38
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,120
'15, '16, I forget.

39
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,440
2015,
I was invited to a

40
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,600
lecture series which you
gave to a smaller

41
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,520
audience, and I was lucky
to watch a few lectures

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
you gave about how, I
think it was How Poor

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,880
Countries Become Rich.

44
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,800
And I was very impressed
at the time about

45
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,200
basically how you
seemed to have thought

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,600
the problems through
and delivered answers

47
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,680
rather than kind of
relying on rigidly

48
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,920
mathematical models.

49
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,480
That's kind of you.

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,960
And I was very
impressed at basically

51
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,400
how you were just able
to communicate ideas

52
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
in a way that ordinary
people would understand.

53
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,760
So, was very impressed,
and I'm very happy

54
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,600
to have you as the first
guest on the channel.

55
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,640
Thanks.

56
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,480
Yeah, actually those
lectures

57
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,640
have been made into this
lecture series called

58
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Economics For People
and available on INET

59
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,720
website, The Institute
for New Economic Thinking.

60
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,040
Yes.

61
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,360
I sometimes get people
tweet photos of me

62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,840
asking you a question,
saying, "Oh, here's-"

63
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,360
That's right, you
asked some sharp questions.

64
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,920
Yeah.

65
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,200
Looking, looking
younger and fresher,

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
less jaded by politics.

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,880
So would you be able to
introduce yourself a

69
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,480
little to the audience,
talk a little bit about

70
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
why you chose to
study economics,

71
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,520
when you started, why
you chose to move

72
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,080
to the UK to study,
because I know this is

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
not where you're from
originally.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,560
That's right.

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm Ha-Joon Chang.

77
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm a professor at
SOAS, University of

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,880
London, at the moment.

79
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,160
I used to teach in
Cambridge for over three

80
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,640
decades.

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,760
I've moved to SOAS recently.

82
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,080
Yes, I was born in
South Korea in 1963.

83
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,920
That was right at
the beginning of the

84
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,080
country's so-called
economic miracle.

85
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,520
And, you know, really
that was

86
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,440
where I grew up and when
I grew up that I wanted to

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,440
study economics, because,
you know, at the time,

88
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,000
South Korea was
growing at like 10%,

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
12%, sometimes at 15.

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
This is when you were
sort of in your teens?

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,960
That's... Yeah,
that's right,

92
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,720
In the
'60s and '70s, yeah.

93
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,520
And yeah, I mean, the
people's living

94
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,000
standards were rising
really rapidly and, you

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,120
know, the new buildings
going new towns

96
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,040
are forming.

97
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,760
Yeah, so there were a lot
of good things

98
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,080
going on then because, you know, at

99
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,200
that level of
income, you know, the

100
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,040
South Korea's income,
per, per capita income,

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,280
you know, for example, in
the, the ni- early

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,720
1970s when I was a primary
school student was

103
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,800
like, $400, yeah?

104
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,720
Yeah, so I think...

105
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
It was a very
poor country-

106
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,080
Yeah.

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,600
which meant that this economic growth

108
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,360
really was
literally a matter of

109
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,600
life and death, you know.

110
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,080
Yeah.

111
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,600
Because that in that, at that

112
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
level of development, if
your economy grows at

113
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,160
5% rather than
the 1%, it means that

114
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,320
you eat one
more bowl of rice

115
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,360
Was it still like a very
agricultural economy-

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
at that time.

117
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,240
but you know,
like 60... 50-60% of

118
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,400
people were in
the countryside,

119
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,240
engaged in farming.

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,680
But also because
the country was

121
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,760
industrialising rapidly

122
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,360
literally millions
of people were arriving

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,240
in Seoul, the
capital city, and

124
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,920
Busan, Ulsan, these industrial cities

125
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,520
in the Southeast
to find jobs

126
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
in factories, yeah?

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,680
But the life was very
hard for the workers,

128
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,560
you know, because
this was a time when

129
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,240
these workers are working
13, 14 hours a day,

130
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,480
six and a half days a week.

131
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
In factories, in cities?

132
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,600
Ye- yeah.

133
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,240
Exactly, yeah.

134
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,560
And some factories refused

135
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,840
to serve soup in the
canteen so that they

136
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,680
don't have to give extra toilet break

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,160
No, no.

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,920
this was a very,
very harsh time.

139
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,560
Yeah.

140
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,240
But, you know, things were

141
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,040
improving.

142
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,840
On the other hand, you
know, you had

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,160
these workers you
know, being

144
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,320
worked to death, and you know,

145
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,120
slums springing
up in urban

146
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,640
areas, and then the-
Okay.

147
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,720
property developers
mobilising

148
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,320
these thugs to beat people up

149
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,280
to clear illegal
settlements.

150
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,040
So you've got this
rapidly urbanising and,

151
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,040
like, growth is high,
incomes are growing,

152
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,720
but living standards are
still really poor for a

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
lot of people, That's right.

154
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,440
the cities are growing
in sort of slum fashion.

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Yeah.

156
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,160
Exactly.

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,080
And then there
were a lot of tension

158
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,440
because, you
know, the country was

159
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,000
between 1961 and
'87 ruled by a

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,800
military dictatorship.

161
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,880
Even though this military government,

162
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,720
was able to
engineer this rapid

163
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,640
economic development
into the very brutal-

164
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,080
yeah.

165
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
And as I grew up,
I just, I wanted to

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
understand what's going on
around me.

167
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,600
And you, you're, you
were growing up in, like,

168
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,520
a middle-class family?

169
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
In Seoul?

171
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,840
That's right, yeah.

172
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
My father was a high
ranking civil servant,

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,320
in the Ministry
of Finance, and yeah.

174
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,080
I mean, okay, I mean,
we were not rich, but,

175
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,160
well off, yeah?

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,480
I guess by the standards
of a career which was

177
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
quite poor at the time.

178
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,880
Yeah, exactly.

179
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,120
Yeah.

180
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,600
So, when I was a kid,
our house was the only

181
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,720
house in the neighborhood
with a TV, you know?

182
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
Okay.

183
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,880
So people went to...

184
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,080
came to our
house to watch

185
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
a football matches,

186
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,240
a boxing match.

187
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,840
So
you were witnessing, I

188
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
guess, it sounds like
a period of really

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
rapid economic change

190
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,200
and economic growth, and,
like, that interested

191
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,640
you and excited you.

192
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,240
That's right, yeah.

193
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,880
So there were
a lot of positive

194
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,840
things happening,
but also a lot of

195
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,480
negative things, yeah?

196
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,040
I mean this exploitation of

197
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,520
workers, you know?

198
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,560
Yeah.

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,520
Political
repression, you know?

200
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,280
It's interesting to hear
you talk about the, like,

201
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
the rapidly growing cities
and the rapidly growing

202
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,280
slums because obviously
at the moment, we have

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
a government that is
obsessed with growth,

204
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,440
and they want to build,
they want to build,

205
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,200
they want to build.

206
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,800
And, I come from,
like, a very poor

207
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,520
part of East London.

208
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,040
Yeah.

209
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,720
And I'm seeing, you
know, I'm sure it's not

210
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,120
the same, but I'm seeing
this, like, rapid growth

211
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,320
of these poorer
outer London suburbs,

212
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,000
and basically
turning into slums.

213
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,320
Yeah.

214
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,120
I was saying before,
the Daily Mail went

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
to my house last week.

216
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
And I think they
wanted to do, like,

217
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,360
the house I grew up in,
and they wanted to do

218
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,640
a story like, "Oh, you
know, Gary said he was

219
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,840
poor, but he's actually
not." And the story

220
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,800
they actually wrote was,
"Oh my God, this place

221
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,400
is a slum." They
couldn't believe it.

222
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
so it's interesting to see

223
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,120
You know, And I often
worry that this like,

224
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,080
this rapid, like,
move for growth

225
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,600
will lead to the
slumification of London.

226
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,320
No, I mean, of
course, I mean,

228
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,800
it was worse in Korea
at the time because

229
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,760
the general living
standard was lower.

230
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,600
But yeah, I mean, if you
expand too fast

231
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,720
these builders are
not going to build

232
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,760
houses of good standard.

233
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,720
Yeah, and of course,

234
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,840
we're only a few years
out from the Grenfell

235
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
disaster, you know?

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Exactly.

237
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
I sometimes worry that
this, "Let's slash the

238
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,560
red tape," sometimes
feels shocking to me.

239
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah.

240
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,080
I mean, the housing
problem has to be

241
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,000
solved by, you know, the
regulation and the

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,640
more equal distribution
of assets, I mean,

243
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,600
you cannot solve it by building

244
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,440
more houses.

245
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,800
It seems a bit
naive to me.

246
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,840
But let's get back to,
you're a child in Korea.

247
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,720
It was my fault.

248
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,920
You're interested in
economics, and you decide

249
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,040
that you, you moved to, in
the UK when you were 18?

250
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,160
No, no, no, no.

251
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
Actually, I went
to university in Korea.

252
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,920
Okay.

253
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,480
In Seoul?

254
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah.

255
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
So we studied
economics, and, yeah, some

256
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,600
professors were different,
but most of the professors

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,320
were just teaching
this equilibrium

258
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,640
models, you know?

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
The similar models to
what I would have learned.

260
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Exactly.

261
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,480
Mathematically less

262
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
sophisticated,

263
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,840
but the same idea.

264
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,160
Yeah.

265
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,480
Okay.

266
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,720
So just these
are like basically

267
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
very mathematically,
mathematically complex,

268
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,960
mathematical equilibrium
models, not so much

269
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,840
stuff on the history of
economic thought, perhaps?

270
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,200
Yeah.

271
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,040
We had a course
in the history of

272
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,640
economic thought.

273
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,560
And you don't
mind me asking,

274
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
what
years would you have

275
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,680
been studying in Korea?

276
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:40,880
Yeah.

277
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,720
So I entered
university in 1982.

278
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,400
Okay.

279
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,400
And graduated in 1986,
and came to England in

280
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,000
the summer of '86
to start my master's.

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
Okay, just
before was born.

282
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,840
Exactly, yeah, yeah.

283
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm old, yeah.

284
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,560
So well, I, yeah,
entered the university,

285
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,920
most of the professors
were, you know,

286
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,040
teaching this abstract...

287
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,800
In Seoul?

288
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
Yeah, Seoul
National University.

289
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,760
And many of my friends couldn't take

290
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,040
it seriously, you know, because, there's this

291
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
huge upheaval
going on outside the

292
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,720
classrooms, you know?

293
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,000
Economic development,
export success,

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
political
repression, you know?

295
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:21,880
Yeah.

296
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,040
In 1980, the second
military government

297
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,600
committed
this massacre in

298
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,160
actually my father's
hometown killing

299
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,840
thousands of people
who are protesting against

300
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,040
the
coup d'etat and, you know?

301
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,800
So, a lot of us got interested in

302
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,520
finding out whether there's another

303
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,480
way of thinking
about economics.

304
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,880
So you went
into university.

305
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,440
And you got very
interested in economics,

306
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,200
and you were kind of
almost amused by

307
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,760
your university
basically doing maths.

308
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,120
That's right.

309
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
And there's not much
discussion of, there's

310
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,520
all of this crazy stuff
happening, you know?

311
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,800
Exactly.

312
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,960
This is, you know, one
of the great modern

313
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,080
economic miracles, right?

314
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,760
at this period of
Korean economic growth.

315
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah.

316
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,000
So you kind, you
kind of thought...

317
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,800
I mean, I had a
similar thing, really.

318
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,160
Like you sort of, you,
I think sometimes people

319
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,480
are really amazed when I
tell them, we don't talk

320
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,720
about the housing crisis.

321
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,320
That's right, yeah.

322
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,640
And we don't, we don't
talk about the cost

323
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
of living crisis.

324
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Uh-uh.

325
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
What we do is maths.

326
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,520
Yeah.

327
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,080
And I did my undergrad
in the mid-2000s.

328
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,200
Yeah.

329
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,240
And I did my post-grad
2017 to '19.

330
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,160
Yeah, and while you were doing

331
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,000
this, there's

332
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,320
one of the biggest financial crises in the

333
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,640
history of capitalism.

334
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,160
Yeah.

335
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,720
And many professors-
I'm kind of

336
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480
surprised to hear

337
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,760
that even, you know,
this is 30 years earlier

338
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,480
in Korea.

339
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,480
You were also doing
this very, very

340
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,720
heavily mathematised
form of study.

341
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,400
That's right, yeah.

342
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Okay.

343
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,960
Yeah, so I just wanted to study something

344
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,120
different, and I
found out that there

345
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,800
were a few universities in
England and the United

346
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,880
States where you could
study non-Neoclassical

347
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,080
economics, Marxist economics,

348
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,360
development economics,
So, just to make clear,

349
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
we're talking, you didn't
want to do just this

350
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,120
kind of very specific
heavily mathematised.

351
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
That's what you mean when
you say Neoclassical?

352
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,040
Yeah, yeah, I mean already Neoclassical

353
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,280
economics was very
heavily mathematised.

354
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,080
So Neoclassical is
basically like the...

355
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,000
at the moment at elite
universities there's

356
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,080
kind of one... there's
basically there's one-

357
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Exactly, yeah.

358
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
one kind of economics that
you're taught almost, from

359
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,720
my perspective, almost
as if it's like physics,

360
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,480
like a physical science.

361
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,120
That's right, yeah.

362
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,080
So this is a particular
approach to economics

363
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,920
which assumes that the
world is made up of

364
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,000
this selfish rational
individuals, and they,

365
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,520
you know, try to
get ahead and compete with

366
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,640
each other, and that's
what generates wealth and-

367
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,480
And in particular,
what I often talk

368
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,520
about on this channel

369
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,880
is that these models,
these kind of large-scale

370
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,560
heavily mathematical
models, they tend to

371
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,360
use what they call
representative agency.

372
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,720
Which means
that rather than

373
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,720
talking about, we have
whatever 60 million people

374
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,320
in the UK or 40 million
people in Korea, you

375
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
just look at the average.

376
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,200
You say let's look at
one guy, the average guy,

377
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,120
the representative guy.

378
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
Which of course means

379
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,960
there is no inequality.

380
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,080
Exactly, by definition,
There's no equality

381
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,800
in distribution.

382
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,920
And you were studying
the... that was the

383
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,720
same thing you would
have been studying.

384
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,760
Yeah, exactly, and
yeah,

385
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,520
still laughing
when I remember that

386
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,240
incident you know,
these models

387
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,920
that really came on
stream in a major way

388
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
in the 1980s,

389
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
because yeah,
before it was more

390
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,040
of a general equilibrium
and that, that kind of

391
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,120
stuff and, yeah, it,
in my early days in

392
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,480
Cambridge, someone
was, giving a...

393
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,840
a seminar using this
representative

394
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,480
agent model.

395
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,880
Yeah.

396
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,440
He also added this
assumption that

397
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,240
this agent is
non-infinitely lived.

398
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,360
Okay, well, I'm
glad to hear it.

399
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,320
We are like looking at this guy

400
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,960
and one of us
asked, "What does that

401
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,920
mean, 'non-infinitely
lived'?" And

402
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,040
another guy said, "Well,
I guess it means that

403
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,280
we all die in the end."
Yeah.

404
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,760
You know what mean?

405
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:27,800
Yeah.

406
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,520
There's no sense of realism there.

407
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,880
I mean, just whatever makes it

408
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,520
mathematically neat. Yeah.

409
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
I wondered, so-

410
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:36,800
You say

411
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,160
moved to Cambridge in '86?

412
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,640
Exactly, yeah.

413
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,360
To do your post
grad, masters?

414
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,440
That's right, masters
and PhD, and then I

415
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,400
studied with
Professor Bob

416
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,280
Rowthorn who was a famous
Marxist economist.

417
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,800
Okay.

418
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,520
Yeah, although, I mean,
he did lots

419
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
of other things and,

420
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,320
he didn't insist that, I
follow his approach,

421
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,120
so my approach is a bit different from

422
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,240
him, but I really thank
him for, kind of showing

423
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,360
me different types of
economics and, you know,

424
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
teaching me
how to kind of reconcile

425
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,960
them if I have to and...

426
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,320
So you chose to go to
Cambridge because you

427
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,200
thought that Cambridge
was teaching like a more

428
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,560
like diverse range of-
That's right,

429
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,520
ways of looking
at economics?

430
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Yeah, that, at
that time Cambridge was of

431
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,800
course at the bastion of
Keynesian economics.

432
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,160
Okay.

433
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
Can you just

434
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,760
quickly describe what
that means to our viewers

435
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,120
who might not know.

436
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,320
Yeah, Keynesian economics
is economics that

437
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,160
was kind of invented
by the early 20th century

438
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,200
British economist
John Maynard Keynes,

439
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,520
who... well like you, made a lot of money in

440
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,760
the financial market.

441
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,080
He's one of a few
economists who actually

442
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,960
makes money in
the financial market

443
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,840
because surprisingly
many economists that

444
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,080
when they invest
in financial market

445
00:15:59,680 --> 00:15:59,800
they fail.

446
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,840
Not so surprising to me.

447
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,640
But he was rooted in, so
I think

448
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,560
one of the best

449
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,360
economists of all time.

450
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah, exactly.

451
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,040
And he lived through
The Great Depression.

452
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,680
That's right, yeah.

453
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,200
So his argument was look,
you cannot treat

454
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,640
the economy
as a household, yeah?

455
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:16,720
Yeah.

456
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
That is the
mistake that the

457
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,320
current Labour Government
is making, yeah?

458
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,680
We've maxed out

459
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,920
our credit card, you know,
we cannot spend more.

460
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
Of course you can, but

461
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,960
the point is that...

462
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,840
He's basically saying,
if you tax people,

463
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
like tax working people
more and you don't... the

464
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,840
government stops spending,
you'll basically cause

465
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,120
this kind of economic
depression which is that

466
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,680
there's not

467
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,000
enough spending,
businesses will fail.

468
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,640
Then more people
will lose their jobs.

469
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,680
And, well
yeah, this is-

470
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,640
Yeah, so his point was
you know,

471
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,640
that your income is
my spending, you know.

472
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,200
My spending is
your income, yeah.

473
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,600
Although we're kind of
in this weird situation

474
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,800
in the UK now where we
have a government that

475
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,840
seems to want to spend
but is kind of not

476
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,720
able to spend and we'll
discuss more on this.

477
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
But, so basically
I think the point

478
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,840
you're making is at
universities, especially

479
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,440
elite universities,
economics is kind of

480
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,080
taught like there's this
one way of doing things.

481
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,560
Exactly.

482
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,240
Which you're
calling Neoclassical,

483
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,000
neoliberal, which is this
very highly mathematised,

484
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,560
rational individuals, we
look at the averages, but

485
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,960
there are other ways of
thinking about things like

486
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Keynesianism, Marxist

487
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
economics.

488
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,400
And you wanted to,
I guess, study a wider

489
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,560
variety so that's why
you went to Cambridge.

490
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,600
Absolutely, yeah.

491
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,800
Cambridge was, you
know Neoclassical

492
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,560
economics was not
so dominant until the

493
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,080
1950s and '60s, but from the '70s it started

494
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,880
really pushing out
other schools because

495
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
they are more kind of,
accepting of

496
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,040
the status quo.

497
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,560
They don't

498
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,120
ask awkward
questions, yeah?

499
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,400
So it was that really becoming

500
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,280
dominant, but there
was still in the '80s

501
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,000
a few places here and there where

502
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,120
Neoclassical economics
was not dominant.

503
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,280
Cambridge was one

504
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,720
of those places.

505
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,360
Is Cambridge still
like that now?

506
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,120
No.

507
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,760
Okay.

508
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,120
Because when I... so
I went to London School

509
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,440
of Economics, 2005 to
2008, and really to be

510
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,120
honest, I was not, I was
not even really aware that

511
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,680
there were other ways-
Exactly, yeah.

512
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,440
No, no, that's how
it is, these

513
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,080
days and, you know.

514
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,320
Yeah.

515
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,720
So I deliberately
wanted

516
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,560
to come to Cambridge.

517
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,160
Luckily I got accepted,
but you know, when

518
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,800
I told people that
I want to study in

519
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,320
England, I mean, a
lot of people in Korea-

520
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,160
Your friends and-
just couldn't understand

521
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,480
it because

522
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,400
you know, we had no
historic relationship with

523
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,200
England, so studying
abroad meant 90%

524
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,720
going to the US and
maybe 5% to

525
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,920
Germany, 5% to France.

526
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,560
Hardly anyone came to England,

527
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,480
And yeah, I mean, moreover

528
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
people thought wanting to study

529
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,760
anything other than Neoclassical was

530
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,080
career suicide, yeah?

531
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,880
I mean, career hadn't even
begun, but you know.

532
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,080
Yeah.

533
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,320
So.

534
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,160
So have you got
any advice to... We

535
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,400
sometimes get messages

536
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,480
from young people who
are studying economics

537
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
or are interested in
studying economics.

538
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Sometimes we even get
messages from people who

539
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,680
are really interested in
the ideas that we talk

540
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,800
about on this channel,
we talk a lot about

541
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,600
inequality, and they
say, "Where can I learn

542
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,680
about these things,
where should I study?

543
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,880
is it gonna be a
problem if, for me, for

544
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
like career advancement?"
What advice would

545
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,040
you give to young people
who are interested in

546
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,080
studying economics
and actually learning

547
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,000
about the economy?

548
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,080
Yeah, I mean, it's getting more and

549
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,240
more difficult to study
economics in a kind of

550
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,560
pluralistic way that
accepts different

551
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,240
theoretical approaches and
try to learn the best

552
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,120
from all of them,
because most

553
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,240
universities will teach you a very,

554
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
very narrow curriculum

555
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,480
completely dominated

556
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,840
by mathematics, yeah?

557
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,040
Yeah.

558
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,560
So basically a lot of
people want to study

559
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,000
economics because
they want to understand

560
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,880
inequality, you know,
cost of living crisis,

561
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,280
financial crisis
and then they go to the

562
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,440
university and they
don't learn any of those,

563
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,800
and then they do maths
for three years

564
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,000
and they graduate,
you know?

565
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,480
Maybe you could speak a
little bit, because you

566
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,640
were teaching at Cambridge

567
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,320
for quite a long
time, right?

568
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,600
As you've been teaching
at SOAS so you've been

569
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,880
an economics professor and
teacher at universities

570
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,640
for a number of years.

571
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,240
Yeah.

572
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,840
My experience of
studying economics is

573
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,880
when I did my undergrad
I was at LSE, it's a

574
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,800
very elite university.

575
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,800
So lots of
wealthy students.

576
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,080
The truth is
for me, I found the

577
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,120
majority of students
there on the undergrad,

578
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,640
to be honest,

579
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,480
I think they were not, and
I include myself in this.

580
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,480
We were not really that
interested in the economy,

581
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,480
really.

582
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,560
We were there
because we thought,

583
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,720
I think rightly to some
degree, that economics,

584
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,600
especially at an elite
university like LSE, was

585
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,200
a way to get a well-paid

586
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
job.

587
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
It is, yeah.

588
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,160
So how...

589
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,920
What... Is that what you
were seeing when you were

590
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
at Cambridge as well?

591
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

592
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,560
But you know, I mean
there are different

593
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,080
people, so the...

594
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,280
Yeah, even in
Cambridge,

595
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,640
I would say, you know,
30% of the students were

596
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
quite interested in the
real world problems.

597
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,440
And Cambridges-
It's funny that, it's

598
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
quite a small minority

599
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,840
but that's the
same, I think at LSE

600
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
was probably
slightly less.

601
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,920
Yeah, to be fair,
Cambridge

602
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,920
still offers a slightly
more diverse

603
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,040
curriculum than
LSE.

604
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
It used to be
actually very

605
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,440
real world oriented and
diverse and so until

606
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
about 2005, yeah?

607
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
And then
does a major curricular

608
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,440
reform that made it
very mathematical and...

609
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,640
Yeah, so that another
story, but,

610
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,160
so... But the problem
is that even for those

611
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,480
30%, 35%, I mean-

612
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,800
That's just the nature

613
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,280
of the study, the ma- the

614
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,520
The ability to think
about the economy is

615
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
beaten out of them, yeah?

616
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,760
I think, yeah,
I think your

617
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,560
gestures are correct.

618
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,200
So for me, okay, so I
well, when I did

619
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,000
my undergrad I was not
interested in economics.

620
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,640
Really.

621
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Other than its ability
to get me a good job.

622
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,200
And that was almost
everyone at LSE

623
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,920
was like that.

624
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,720
But then I went back to do
a master's, at Oxford,

625
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,400
'17 to '19, and what's interesting about

626
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,640
that is the master's is
not really like necessary

627
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,400
to get a good job.

628
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,600
That's true.

629
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,280
If have a good undergrad.

630
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,920
So then that means
that some of the people

631
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,240
who did the master's

632
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
a much bigger
percentage of them

633
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,080
were kind of interested in

634
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,840
economics.

635
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,800
But of course they've all
had this experience of,

636
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,000
you go to do your
undergrad and maybe you go

637
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,480
in quite naively thinking,
"I'm gonna learn

638
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,880
about the economy."

639
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,120
But the actual experience
is you have to do a lot

640
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,960
of very, very difficult,
essentially algebra exams.

641
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Algebra and calculus
exams, and, you

642
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,680
know, it's just like
complicated maths.

643
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,600
And then those exams
are really hard.

644
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,280
So then you,
you don't... Unless

645
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
you're like super smart,
you don't really have-

646
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,520
Time to do anything else.

647
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,640
Yeah, you, you don't have
time to step back and be

648
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,760
like, "Well, you know,
does it make sense that we

649
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,280
don't look at the... have
any wealth distribution

650
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,840
in the model?" You don't
really ha- you know,

651
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,760
you need to be, and also
if you were to think,

652
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,360
ask those questions,
who do you ask them to?

653
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,960
You know, I was at Oxford.

654
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,200
Oxford had one guy who
looked at inequality.

655
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,480
Was his name
Tony Atkinson?

656
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,400
Yeah.

658
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,280
And he died
1 year before I entered.

659
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,720
Yeah, so I applied
with the hope...

660
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,160
He was a yeah,
very influential

661
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,040
economist in the field
of inequality study.

662
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,760
I think Piketty was
quite an influence.

663
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,160
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,880
So by the time I got
there, there was not

665
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,920
even anybody to speak
to about inequality.

666
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,440
And then, and, you know,
you have to, you have

667
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,280
to study really hard.

668
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,960
And, you know, I didn't
really care about my

669
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,600
grades in master's

670
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
but, you know, it does
whip it out of you,

671
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,840
because if you, if you,

672
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,360
you have to do so much
maths and it's difficult.

673
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,880
Yeah.

674
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
And there's... and
it kind of whips out

675
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,320
anyone who actually
wants to ask these

676
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,360
big questions, it's
like, well, everyone

677
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,000
else is doing 100
hours a week of maths.

678
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,000
And you're sitting around
asking stupid questions.

679
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,800
That's right, yeah.

680
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,960
Yeah, so I think it
does kind of whip,

681
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,400
and I thought it was
really, really sad.

682
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,120
Like, I thought the
smartest kids on that

683
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,520
Oxford post-grad course

684
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,080
they all dropped
out of economics.

685
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,080
Because it was like, well,
the guys were curious.

686
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,200
It was so clear there is
no space here for people

687
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,800
who are curious

688
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
about the economy.

689
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,480
Yeah.

690
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,400
This conversation
reminds me of what

691
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,760
the radical Keynesian
economist,

692
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,600
Joan Robinson said.

693
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,760
I mean, Robinson was
one of the few...

694
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,280
Was she at Cambridge?

695
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,280
... Yeah,
female economist, yeah,

696
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,880
was a big name in
the Keynesian economics.

697
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,600
I mean, she should have
got greater

698
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,280
recognition, but she was very left-wing

699
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,280
and asked a lot of
awkward questions, and

700
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,160
yeah, therefore she was pushed back.

701
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,440
But she once famously said that, "I

702
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,640
had to learn to think
because I wasn't all that

703
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
good at math," you know?

704
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,360
Yeah.

705
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,880
I think it, I
think it, yeah.

706
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,960
Sometimes, maths

707
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,360
becomes substitution
for thinking, yeah?

708
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,760
Yeah, well, I think,
no, I think that's

709
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,560
a really good point.

710
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,680
I think that's a
really good point.

711
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,880
The obsession,
it's insane, Because you

712
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,760
know, especially for
that Oxford post-grad.

713
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,000
You know, it's very
difficult to get

714
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
into, Oxford's a very
prestigious university.

715
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,920
These are really, really
smart kids, and the

716
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,280
reality of it is we
spent two years locked

717
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,440
in tiny windowless rooms
inverting matrices.

718
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:06,920
That's right.

719
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,440
It's insane.

720
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,280
It really, really is
insane, but I think this,

721
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,720
I want to make this
point to our viewers.

722
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,680
because the point I often
make is, you know, at

723
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,920
the end of the day, these
are the guys who are

724
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,280
controlling the economy,

725
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,680
making the decisions
about the economy and-

726
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,480
It's quite worrying,
isn't it, yeah?

727
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,600
Well, the other point
that I make is, and this

728
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,560
something I wanted to
ask you about, was so

729
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,640
when I did my undergrad,
I think LSE is

730
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,920
probably the worst for
this, but I don't think

731
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,840
it's unusual at all.

732
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,280
The vast majority of the
students wanted to be

733
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,800
traders.

734
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,040
Or at the very least
to work in finance.

735
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,760
And the vast majority
of the students with the

736
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,320
best grades did go on
to become traders.

737
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,080
Does that mirror
with what you've seen

738
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,200
as a professor watching
students go through?

739
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,640
Yeah.

740
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
I mean, you cannot
blame them, you know,

741
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
they've... No, I did it myself.

742
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,400
That's right.

743
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,160
Going into trading,
I mean, you will be

744
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,120
making five,
ten times what

745
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,840
you could be making in
any other uh, possible

746
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,960
uh, profession

747
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
The civil service
or whatever.

748
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,200
So that is natural, yeah?

749
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,400
But, you
know, the trouble is

750
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,280
when you train people in
this particular way,

751
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,440
basically maths, and
then put them in

752
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,880
charge of the economies,
a bit like

753
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,960
training people
in, say, biochemistry

754
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,360
and then make them
medical doctors, yeah?

755
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,680
Yeah, so it's related, yeah?

756
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,640
So you have to
understand the principles

757
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,160
of biochemistry and so

758
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,920
in order to understand
human body and so on,

759
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,560
but you need clinical
experiences, yeah?

760
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,960
You should have
actually looked at

761
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,480
actual patients

762
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,880
to know how to
diagnose them as well.

763
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,640
Yes, this is, this is the,
the big thing that

764
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,560
I feel is missing.

765
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,680
And to be honest, it's
why I was impressed

766
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,560
when I went to your
lecture series.

767
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
Which is, I think that
from my personal

768
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,680
experience, first of
all, these guys who

769
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,760
study economics to high
level, they're smart guys.

770
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,640
They're very good-
Of course, yeah.

771
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
To be honest, they're
very good at maths.

772
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,360
Yeah.

773
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,680
But I think there's really
a lack of being able

774
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,120
to, or even in a sense
thinking that it's a thing

775
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,360
you should do, step back
and look at what you're

776
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,800
doing in a, in a sort
of big picture sense.

777
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,200
Yeah.

778
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,000
I always remember when
I was at Oxford, we had

779
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,080
one lecture, and
there was a discussion

780
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,520
of like the aftermath
to the 2008 crisis.

781
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Which the recovery was
much weaker than everybody

782
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,120
predicted, and they were
saying, "We don't know

783
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,480
why." And I put my hand
up and I asked this guy-

784
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,960
"Okay, well, why do
you think it was?"

785
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,160
And he said, and
I think this is

786
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,400
one of the funniest
things I've ever heard.

787
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,120
He said, "We're not sure
why, but we think it was

788
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,880
because of an exogenous
shock to consumption

789
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,200
savings preferences."
Which is, oh, this me,

790
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,600
I have to explain this
to the audience, right?

791
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,360
Exogenous
is a technical term in

792
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,440
economics modeling which
means something outside

793
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,760
of the model has changed.

794
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,040
So I've asked him, "Why
do you think..." You

795
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
know, this is a real
thing that happened in the

796
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,800
real world.

797
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,280
"Why do you think the
recovery was so weak?"

798
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,600
And he said, without
like a hint of irony, "We

799
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,120
think something outside
the model changed."

800
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
And that is crazy.

801
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,640
It's a cr- but I think
it shows exactly when you

802
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,520
make a guy do so, do so
much maths in the model

803
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,080
they forget that the model

804
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,920
is not the real world.

805
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,920
And when you reach the
point that you start

806
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,480
explaining things in
the real world by using

807
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,920
technical terms, saying
something outside the

808
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,080
model has changed, I
think this captures

809
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,680
like exactly what has
gone wrong.

810
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,320
And the maddest thing
is, nobody in the hall

811
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,400
even laughs, you know?

812
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,600
They just think, they're

813
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,360
just like, they...

814
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,160
I think this form of
like very, very intense

815
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,800
forcing people to do maths

816
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,880
is almost like
a brainwashing.

817
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,200
That's right, yeah, yeah.

818
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
No, I mean, first
of all, you know, that

819
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,880
what this guy was
implicitly saying

820
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,440
was "Suddenly people
didn't want to spend."

821
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah, which is the
whole answer, yeah.

822
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,360
Why, yeah?

823
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,880
Yeah.

824
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,680
Some I don't know,
alien overlord that...

825
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,080
Yeah, came in and
changed the world.

826
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,480
Yeah.

827
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,800
That's right, came and
changed people.

828
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
I mean, that's
so stupid.

829
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,200
But secondly, even
if that is the

830
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,400
case, then why are you
not putting that

831
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,600
into your model, yeah?

832
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,440
Yeah, it's-
So it's that,

833
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,560
like, you know,
I mean, unfortunately,

834
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,240
this is now
kind of verging

835
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,640
on becoming a
theology, you know.

836
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:32,840
I mean-

837
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,480
Yeah, yeah, I saw.

838
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't know

839
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,320
if you realise.

840
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
I know you're not
on social media.

841
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,160
There is a clip
of you kind of going

842
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,800
viral on social media.

843
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,840
Oh, yeah, yeah,
Are you aware of this?

844
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,560
Well, yeah, my son,
who's...

845
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,120
who's working in the
the Royal Institution.

846
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
He's a biologist.

847
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,520
But even he saw it.

848
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,240
People keep sending it
to me, yeah, of you

850
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,680
basically saying like...

851
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
And I think it's a
really good point and I

852
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,000
think it's totally true.

853
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,720
Like it or not, economics has become

854
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,280
a bit like Catholic
theology in medieval

855
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,840
Europe.

856
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,080
It has, basically
become the language

857
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,920
of the rulers.

858
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,160
So, if you don't
speak economics, you

859
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,200
cannot participate
in any debate.

860
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,520
Unless you're able to
speak in this language,

861
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,920
use these terms, you're
basically not allowed

862
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,080
to have an opinion.

863
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,480
And it kind of locks...

864
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,280
To be honest, like,
it locks poor people

865
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,680
out of the
conversation.

866
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,280
Yeah, absolutely.

867
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,200
This... I mean,
this scary parallel

868
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,960
with Catholic theology
in medieval Europe

869
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,280
Yeah.

870
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,680
So, theology at
the time was justifying

871
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,200
whatever is going
on in the world.

872
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,800
Yeah?

873
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:39,880
Yeah.

874
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,600
You know, famine and
exploitation.

875
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,320
You know, the
abuse of power.

876
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,840
Whatever, it's all in God's will, yeah?

877
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,600
Today, whatever is
going wrong in

878
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,360
the world is
justified by economics.

879
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,840
Yeah, must be-
This must be what is

880
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,240
best for the economy.

881
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,000
Exactly, yeah.

882
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,400
Yeah.

883
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,280
Best of all possible
worlds, yeah?

884
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
And

885
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,400
to make it worse-
they, they use that

886
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
term a lot in economi-
well, they use, "The

887
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,000
first best optimal."
Yeah, exactly.

888
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,960
Have you, have you read
Candide by Voltaire?

889
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

890
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,960
Yeah, so there's a
book, it influenced

891
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
me a lot in my book,
where he talks about-

892
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
this, It's
by Voltaire.

893
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,040
Hundreds of years ago.

894
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,200
He says that

895
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,880
back in the day

896
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,440
they justified everything
by saying, "If it wasn't

897
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,720
supposed to be like this-"
That's right.

898
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,960
"... God wouldn't have
made it like this."

899
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,400
Yeah, exactly.

900
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,840
"This must be the best
of all possible worlds or

901
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,600
God would've made
it differently."

902
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,120
Yeah.

903
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,600
And economics
uses sometimes

904
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,240
similar language.

905
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,760
They say like, "The first
best optimal outcome."

906
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,760
"If it wasn't supposed to
be like this, the economy

907
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,640
wouldn't have made this."
Absolutely.

908
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
But what I want to...

909
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,360
The point which I make a
lot on this channel is if

910
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,280
you reach high levels in
this debate about how we

911
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,720
should run the economy,
how we should manage the

912
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,640
economy, so if you become
a prestigious academic

913
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,280
or if you become a
high level politician, or

914
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,640
if you become, working
in the central bank,

915
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,280
or even high level media,
you're quite rich

916
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,800
by that point.

917
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,280
Yeah.

918
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,240
And then what you have
is a group of rich people

919
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,360
basically refusing to
allow poor people into

920
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,320
the conversation because
they're saying, "Sorry,

921
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,200
you can't speak the
maths," saying, "We think

922
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,680
nothing should change"

923
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,120
as a way of justifying
a system which,

924
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,720
from where I'm standing,
appears to make the

925
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,840
rich richer every year.

926
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,360
Yeah.

927
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,840
And is, is... It's
crushing living standards.

928
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah, we have to remember,
you know, during the, the

929
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,440
medieval times, the
Vatican did not allow the

930
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,560
Bible to be translated

931
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,000
into vernacular languages.

932
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,920
It all had to be in Latin.

933
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,640
So most people
couldn't read Latin.

934
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,600
And therefore, they had to just

935
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,680
take the
priest's word

936
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,840
for... I mean, the...

937
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,880
Yeah, the face

938
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,400
value, yeah?

939
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,680
This is basically why
the Daily Mail has

940
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
run four stories on me
in four consecutive

941
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,960
days, because...

942
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,640
You are dangerous.

943
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,440
What I'm trying to do on
this channel, and I think

944
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,240
it's also a lot of what
you're trying to do,

945
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,280
in the work that you do,
but also your books, which

946
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,800
are very accessible to
ordinary people is, you're

947
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,680
trying to explain what's
happening to ordinary

948
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,360
people in a language
they can understand.

949
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,440
And well, I talk about
it a lot on this channel,

950
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,240
what I think is happening
is that the distribution

951
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,920
is changing.

952
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,760
The wealth distribution is
changing in front of us.

953
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,040
Ordinary people
are getting poorer.

954
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,640
The rich and the very
rich are getting richer.

955
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,480
And I think if
people... You know, I

956
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,760
said it a lot on this
channel, what I see

957
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,320
my mission as is really
quite simply getting

958
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,880
people to understand
what is happening.

959
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,680
Absolutely, yeah.

960
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,040
Because if people
understood what is

961
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,600
happening and also what's
goIng to happen, so in my

962
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,200
opinion, and don't know
how much of our videos

963
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,680
you've watched, I think
this crisis of wealth

964
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,800
inequality will get worse.

965
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,840
I think it's, it's
really going to...

966
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,960
It's already decimated
the working classes

967
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,920
in the West.

968
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,040
I think it's starting to
decimate the middle class.

969
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,920
You're seeing how it's
basically impoverishing

970
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,560
the government, and that
is happening in a context

971
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,800
of rapidly growing wealth
of the richest.

972
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,200
Yeah, and now, I mean,
in places like the US,

973
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
although it's happening in other

974
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,560
countries at a lower
level, you know, now

975
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,560
there's blatant
money politics, yeah?

976
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,400
Yeah.

977
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,880
Well, I saw on the
news this morning- we

978
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,800
had Elon Musk offering
people a million dollars-

979
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,240
Exactly,
if you voted his way.

980
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,720
Yeah.

981
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,320
Well, this is another
point I like to make

982
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,360
a lot, which is,
distribution of wealth

983
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,720
is distribution of power
and, it's control over

984
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,480
resources, but it's also
control over the media

985
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,280
and it's also control
over the politicians.

986
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,760
Exactly.

987
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,120
Now, we're in a

988
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,920
downward spiral
because it's

989
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,040
feeding into each other.

990
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
So, the more inequality,
economic inequality

991
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,360
gives more power to
this rich people

992
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,560
Yeah.

993
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,360
Which they can then

994
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,560
use to take more power.

995
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:37,960
Yeah, that's right.

996
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,800
I talk about
this a lot actually.

998
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,560
I talk about basically
these dynamics

999
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,360
which you're talking
about, which is

1000
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,560
the more power they have,
the more they can... The

1001
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,040
quicker they can take
the rest of the power-

1002
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,560
which means they will
then have more power.

1003
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,480
And I think that this is
the kind of spiral that,

1004
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,600
that we are in, and
yeah, I'll be honest,

1005
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,080
I speak about it a lot.

1006
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,440
I'm really worried
about where this goes.

1007
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,400
Like, on the first
level in terms of living

1008
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,120
standards, but also in
terms of, in terms of

1009
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,880
politics, because... Well,
first, I suppose, I'll

1010
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,000
ask you this question.

1011
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,680
I think, unfortunately,
that unless we get

1012
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,360
some change on taxation
inequality, which I don't

1013
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,880
think we will get, at
least in the short term,

1014
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,760
I think living
standards in... for

1015
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
the West, for the
working class, for

1016
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,120
the middle class, will
continue to decrease.

1017
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,520
Do you think

1018
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,040
that's likely?

1019
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,440
You have so-called
Labour Government

1020
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,200
cutting benefits, yeah?

1021
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,240
Yeah.

1022
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,280
Disability benefits
of all things, yeah.

1023
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,880
I think unless... I know,
you know, I'm trying to

1024
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
get some influence with,
with the Labour Party

1025
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,760
obviously the government
of this country.

1026
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,320
Why do you think they're
so reluctant to discuss

1027
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,520
taxing the riches?

1028
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,520
Well, I mean, a
a kind of charitable

1029
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,720
interpretation is that
they are scared of the

1030
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,000
financial market, yeah.

1031
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,960
Yeah, but you know...

1032
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,360
Yeah, but I think-
If you borrow a lot,

1033
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
so I think at the moment
we're in this space

1034
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,040
where they, they want
to borrow, it's just

1035
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,800
borrow, borrow, borrow.

1036
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,040
But if you borrow from
the financial markets,

1037
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,440
you know, you are
essentially borrowing

1038
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,080
from the rich.

1039
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,360
Yeah.

1040
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,120
If borrowing is
your only plan

1041
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,160
then you are a slave to
the financial markets.

1042
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,960
You know, if I...

1043
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,560
if my plan is to
borrow from you,

1044
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,000
then I need you
to agree to that.

1045
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,520
If my plan is to tax
you, I don't need

1046
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,240
you to agree to that.

1047
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,320
So I think really the
way to break out of that

1048
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,600
fear of financial markets
is to start talking about,

1049
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,920
about taxation and, and...

1050
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,080
well, I'll tell
you what I think.

1051
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,640
You didn't ask, but I'll
tell you what I think.

1052
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,120
I think these guys,
they're being pressured

1053
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,080
by their rich funders.

1054
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,960
I think they don't want to
push back on it basically.

1055
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,920
But I think also,
I think there is a

1056
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,880
real lack of economists
in looking at things

1057
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,480
like the distribution.

1058
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah, so unfortunately I
think that economists

1059
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,920
in the Labour Party, they are still living

1060
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,720
in this mental
cage built by

1061
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,000
Margaret Thatcher, yeah?

1062
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,840
Yeah.

1063
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,680
So the high taxation
for the rich is

1064
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,200
bad, you know, the
private ownership

1065
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,600
of everything is good, that kind of...

1066
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,960
I mean, unfortunately,
I'm sure that they

1067
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,760
are uncomfortable
with it, but

1068
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,720
they haven't been
able to develop a

1069
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,520
counter-narrative, yeah?

1070
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,560
No, let's look
at some facts.

1071
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,000
You know, in the
1960s and '70s, Britain

1072
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,400
was one of the most
equal countries in

1073
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,320
the world, you know?

1074
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,760
People don't

1075
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,680
often realise it.

1076
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
The country was growing faster than what

1077
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,680
it is... has been
growing in the last

1078
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,320
30 years,

1079
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,200
despite having,
you know, top income tax

1080
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,400
rate of 80%, yeah?

1081
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,600
Yeah.

1082
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,440
In the US at the time, the
top income tax rate was

1083
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
even higher, 90%, yeah?

1084
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,760
But it was growing much faster

1085
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,840
than what it is doing today, you know?

1086
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,760
At least try to use those

1087
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,880
historical facts
to develop some

1088
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,120
counter-narrative,
you know?

1089
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,600
But since they haven't developed

1090
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,080
this counter-narrative
and basically

1091
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,680
given up on the taxing
the rich taxing

1092
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,320
wealth and so on

1093
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,760
what do they do?

1094
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,960
There's
only one way to

1095
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,240
spend more which is

1096
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,040
borrowing which that creates

1097
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,600
the problem that you
just talked about.

1098
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,280
Yeah, I th- I think it's,
I think it's kind of the

1099
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,720
same thing which I said
before, which is like

1100
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,760
a bit of an inability,
and I think maybe we kind

1101
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
of teach this a little bit
in the way that we... the

1102
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,440
way that we educate people
in university now. An

1103
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,040
inability to step back and
look at the big picture.

1104
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,120
And the big thing which
I often talk about was,

1105
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
you know, and the reason
I started my channel was

1106
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,120
at the beginning of COVID,
it was very clear that the

1107
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,280
UK government and the US
government and basically

1108
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,840
all Western governments
were going to give a

1109
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,880
huge amount of money out.

1110
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,480
And the UK deficit as
I said is £1 trillion,

1111
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,280
and all wanted to know,
because my background is

1112
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,200
distribution inequality,
who is going to get

1113
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,800
that £1 trillion?

1114
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,640
That's the only thing
I wanted to know.

1115
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,760
Because you know, the
US number is, I think,

1116
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,720
$13 trillion, you know,
huge numbers, you're

1117
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,560
obviously going to change
the distribution here,

1118
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,160
you're obviously going to
change the distribution

1119
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,560
but I think it
was so amazing,

1120
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,400
just nobody asked.

1121
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,360
Nobody, and I
think we've...

1122
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,240
I think personally, it
goes back, I honestly

1123
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,120
think it goes back to
the way that we teach

1124
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,240
our economic students.

1125
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,520
This way that we just whip
them into do the maths,

1126
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,880
do the maths, do the
maths, don't question the

1127
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,320
model, don't think about
the big picture, and then

1128
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,040
you reach a point where,
you know, we can give

1129
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,880
out £1 trillion, the
Americans can give out

1130
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,520
$13 trillion, and because
our models never question

1131
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,720
distribution, nobody
even asks where it's

1132
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,200
going to end up.

1133
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,960
I think it's,
I think it's amazing.

1134
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
Well this extra
money was

1135
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,640
basically given to
banks and other

1136
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,680
financial institutions,
which they refused

1137
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,680
to give it to productive
enterprises that need this

1138
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,320
money for investment,

1139
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,240
to give to
ordinary consumers...

1140
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,080
sorry, ordinary
citizens, yeah?

1141
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah.

1142
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,200
I mean, why couldn't they
do it with more

1143
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,880
kind of taxation

1144
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,240
you know I mean?

1145
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,640
Okay, I mean if you think generally high

1146
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,000
level of taxation
is not a good

1147
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,400
thing, at least you can,
have emergency

1148
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,720
taxations, yeah?

1149
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,560
A lot of countries
did that, yeah?

1150
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,440
During wartime and
in the post-war

1152
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,400
reconstruction, they
would kind of,

1153
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,600
occasionally impose a special levy

1154
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,160
of whatever percent on the rich people for

1155
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,240
five years or whatever.

1156
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,320
Yeah.

1157
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,440
Yeah, I think it's
interesting you mention

1158
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,000
wartime periods, because,
you know, we've... So the

1159
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,120
channel has really been
growing and it's becoming

1160
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,880
really popular, and
you know, this... this

1161
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,160
argument of why are you
not taxing the rich is

1162
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,080
growing and growing and
growing and growing. And

1163
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,000
I think we actually
made some good progress,

1164
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,600
because for a long time
we would get this kind

1165
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,640
of economic pushbacks,
it's not good for

1166
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,040
the economy, it's not
good for the economy.

1167
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,200
There's no
evidence for that.

1168
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,800
No, there's not

1169
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,280
and, but increasingly
people are not

1170
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,920
believing that

1171
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,360
but the argument against
has kind of shifted

1172
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,000
to this like, well,
it's not possible

1173
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,400
you can't tax rich people

1174
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,960
and this kind of
fatalistic, well,

1175
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,840
things always get worse

1176
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,600
you can't do anything.

1177
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,480
But then if you look back
at especially the Second

1178
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,960
World War in Europe,
in the West, there

1179
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,720
was a massive decrease
in wealth inequality.

1180
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,200
Oh, absolutely.

1181
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,520
So it's obviously,
it's obviously doable.

1182
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,440
Why... I don't know,
have you got anything

1183
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,080
you can say about
whether it's possible, and

1184
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,040
also why so many people
are so quick to say it's

1185
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,640
impossible when we have
this historical example?

1186
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,880
I think one reason
why it is more difficult

1187
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,840
than before is that
downward spiral that we

1188
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,120
have talked about, yeah?

1189
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,120
Increasing inequality
feeding into

1190
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,040
increasing
inequality of power

1191
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,200
and democracy being
more and more

1192
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,600
constrained.

1193
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:00,960
Yeah, yeah.

1194
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,640
So, that's one reason why I think

1195
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,720
it is more difficult
to do that now than

1196
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah.

1197
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,920
it was possible
in the 1950s or '60s.

1198
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,040
I think this is a really
good point because I

1199
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,280
think people push back and
they say it's impossible

1200
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,480
because you can't do it
technically, but the

1201
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,520
Second World War proves
it's technically possible.

1202
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,720
The truth is, what makes
it very, very difficult,

1203
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,480
in my opinion, is that
control of the media

1204
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,080
and the control of

1205
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,640
politicians because
whenever I go

1206
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,120
on TV or radio

1207
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,240
to campaign for wealth
taxes, I'm always

1208
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,640
doing it for free

1209
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,360
and I'm self-funded.

1210
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,040
And I'm up against
somebody who works

1211
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,800
for a think tank

1212
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,200
funded by billionaires.

1213
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,640
And sometimes people...

1214
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,400
if you wonder why
there's not more voices

1215
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
like me in the media

1216
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,360
because who funds it?

1217
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,480
The billionaires are
actively paying for

1218
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,720
people to go on TV

1219
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,360
go on the radio and
say it's impossible

1220
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:53,880
to tax the rich.

1221
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,600
Who is paying

1222
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,320
for people like me to
make the counterargument?

1223
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,160
You know,
basically nobody.

1224
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,280
So that shows you

1225
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,800
really, the way they
block it is by fighting

1226
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,640
that narrative battle.

1227
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,360
And winning that narrative
Yeah, exactly, yeah, but

1228
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,680
there you have, Nelson
Mandela once said, "It

1229
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,680
always looks impossible
until it is done," yeah?

1230
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah.

1231
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,440
We can do it, we
have to do it.

1232
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,160
We have to start
somewhere, yeah?

1233
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,960
I mean,
okay, I mean

1234
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,960
change the narrative,
maybe put

1235
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,040
more pressure on your
politicians, yeah, and

1236
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,400
do more mass
economic literacy

1237
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,600
campaigns so that

1238
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
more people know
about these things

1239
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,400
like you are
doing in a very,

1240
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,480
very effective way.

1241
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,120
I mean, we have to
change this, yeah?

1242
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,600
Yeah.

1243
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,600
And it can be done.

1244
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,560
Okay, maybe the 90% is too much, yeah?

1245
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,480
But why should it
be 40% or 50%?

1246
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,400
It could be the
60%, 70%, yeah?

1247
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,440
And I always talk
about how it's not even

1248
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,280
necessarily just about
what rates we tax income.

1249
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,440
You know, we have
these very, very

1250
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,560
wealthy families-
That's right, we have-

1251
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,600
they don't pay income tax.

1252
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,240
tax wealth, yeah.

1253
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,400
Yeah, I think this
is the big thing.

1254
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,840
They don't have
income in the-

1255
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,360
Yeah, their
income is not

1256
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,160
classed as income.

1257
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,480
Exactly.

1258
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,280
But, you know, they
do receive billions

1259
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,440
of pounds in
their lifetime.

1260
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,960
I think...
I think often what is,

1261
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,680
what is often done is
when I say want to tax the

1262
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,880
rich, my opponents try to
convince the public that

1263
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,040
means you, that means you.

1264
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,560
And they, they try
to ignore, you know,

1265
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,000
there are families out
there with hundreds

1266
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,520
of millions, billions
of pounds of wealth.

1267
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,720
Their wealth is growing
and growing and growing

1268
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,880
and they're
squeezing people out.

1269
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,000
Yeah.

1270
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,840
They're squeezing
people out.

1271
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,920
This is the worry I have.

1272
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,680
But, I think...

1273
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,000
I look at the growth
of this narrative

1274
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,000
the massive growth
and support for it.

1275
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,320
I think we can win the
public battle for it, but

1276
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,040
I think we need more
support from economists.

1277
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,080
Which is why I'm always
glad to hear you're doing

1278
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,040
the work you're doing.

1279
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,080
And I'm hoping
we get more young people

1280
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,520
going into economics
to push this...

1281
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,480
push this narrative.

1282
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,320
I think that, I
think that's really good.

1283
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,240
I guess I would like to
end on just asking you,

1284
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,160
I can often be a little
bit pessimistic and a

1285
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,560
little bit depressing,
but I do this work

1286
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,600
because I think we can
make things better.

1287
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,560
So at these times
when living standards

1288
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,720
are falling and we have
increased political

1289
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,640
turbulence, what is
it that gives you

1290
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,160
hope for our future
as a society and our

1291
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,960
future as an economy?

1292
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,680
Yeah, well, I, yeah, you
know, try to live by the

1293
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,000
dictum of the Italian
Marxist philosopher

1294
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,960
Antonio Gramsci who said
that we need the pessimism

1295
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,520
of the intellect,
but optimism of

1296
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,840
the will, yeah?

1297
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
Yeah, so you have to
be realistic about

1298
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,040
what can be achieved
at the moment.

1299
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,480
Yeah.

1300
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,320
You know, so that
makes you pessimistic

1301
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:52,480
because debts
kind of stack

1302
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,920
so much against the ordinary people, but

1303
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,480
in the long run, you know,
the world has

1304
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,920
changed hugely, yeah?

1305
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,200
If changes
weren't impossible

1306
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,480
you know, we'd be still
living in a society

1307
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,200
with slaves and
most people are

1308
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,160
you know, tied to
their land and do not have

1309
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,760
any freedom to choose their profession.

1310
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,840
You know, the women
will not be allowed

1311
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,440
to vote, you know.

1312
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,560
There'll be explicit racial

1313
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,840
discrimination.

1314
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,560
But these things
all have changed

1315
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,800
because people have fought for it, yeah?

1316
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,280
So if you take the perspective of 50

1317
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,680
years, 100 years, yeah?

1318
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,400
We can change
this, you know.

1319
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,880
I think that's the
key thing is because

1320
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,760
people fought for it.

1321
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:36,960
Yeah.

1322
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,080
Because people
fought for it.

1323
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,160
Exactly.

1324
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,000
I think we can.

1325
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,760
I'm fighting for it.

1326
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,920
I know you're
doing your bit.

1327
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,280
Yeah, thank
you very much.

1328
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,440
Thanks for coming
on the channel.

1329
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,000
That's great for me.

1330
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,520
Is there anything you

1331
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,720
wanted to, you wanted
to bring up or anything

1332
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,240
you want to speak about?

1333
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,120
I mean, I'm very
honored to be

1334
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,720
the first outside
speaker in your

1335
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,080
great series.

1336
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,200
Yeah, I mean, please
get other

1337
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,800
speakers so that you
can diversify

1338
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,120
your... I mean,
what you are doing

1339
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,240
is great, but, you
know, we need

1340
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,920
kind of different
people coming in too.

1341
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,480
Yeah, I think we need-
Give, different

1342
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,080
perspectives.

1343
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,720
it's important for
us to have more

1344
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,520
economists, I think.

1345
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,560
Because this channel is
like, it's getting so

1346
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,040
popular with the public,
but, you know, we have all

1347
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,200
of these rich posh guys,
"Oh, no, I never work.

1348
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,440
Oh, no, I never work."
And, you know, we live

1349
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,280
in a very class-focused
society. And, I

1350
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,240
think... I'm from a
working-class background,

1351
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,200
and think one of the
reasons why the channel

1352
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,120
is popular is because
the country's from a

1353
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,840
working-class background.

1354
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,600
They're happy
to hear that.

1355
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,640
But the fact is,
the guys who control

1356
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,360
the levers of power

1357
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,040
they're normally
not from working-class

1358
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,200
backgrounds.

1359
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah, but there
are some kind of

1360
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
good economists
working on these issues.

1361
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,760
You know, get Piketty or Zucman, yeah?

1362
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,000
Yeah, you know, I
think we'll reach out.

1363
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,520
We'll reach out.

1364
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,720
I think Piketty and
Zucman are great.

1365
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,360
They're French economists
working in inequality.

1366
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,680
But yeah, thank you
very much for coming on.

1367
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,360
Ha-Joon has not
asked me to, to recommend

1368
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,160
his books, but,
I think Ha-Joon

1369
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,880
has a lot of books out.

1370
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,600
His recent one is
Edible Economics, which

1371
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,480
is here on the table.

1372
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,520
He didn't ask me to do
this, honestly he didn't.

1373
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,160
I think Ha-Joon
writes really well

1374
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,320
economics in a way that
is enjoyable and relatable

1375
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,280
to ordinary people.

1376
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,800
So, if you're watching and
you find economics

1377
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,520
inaccessible, and
you want... I obviously

1378
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,440
haven't written any
books about economics,

1379
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,040
like straight books
about economics, but

1380
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,360
I think Ha-Joon's
books are really good.

1381
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,560
And if you've
got questions for

1382
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,320
Ha-Joon, send them in
and maybe we'll get

1383
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,400
him on again someday.

1384
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
But, yeah, basically,
thank you very much-

1385
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:29,800
Thank you.

1386
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,280
for coming on.

1387
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,000
I really enjoyed
this time.

1388
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,240
Great.

1389
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,360
And, yeah, good
to see you again.

1390
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,600
Thank you very much.

1391
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,400
And thank you very
much for your support.

1392
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,920
Keep watching, share
the videos with your

1393
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,080
friends, with your mum.

1394
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,920
It's all about
stopping the economy

1395
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,600
from getting worse.

1396
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,520
It's about taxing
wealth and not work.

1397
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,760
Support us.

1398
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,440
Thank you very much.
