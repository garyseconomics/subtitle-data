1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,960
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,280
Today, we are going to explain how you lose your house.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
Alright, I wanted to do a video that explains very explicitly

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,520
how you lose your house.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,200
Because we exist in a country

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,440
and in the world, in fact, of rapidly growing wealth inequality.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,080
And yet when I talk about this,

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,280
we often see a number of people saying, well,

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,840
you know, I own my own property.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,520
You know, I'm going to pass my property on to my kids,

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to get my property from my parents.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,760
So I don't want tax to be raised because, you know, we're okay.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,480
We've got property we're going to protect that.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,680
The reality of the situation is

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
that ordinary families are getting poorer.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,960
They losing their wealth.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,400
So I want to explain explicitly how that is happening.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,920
So I think the first thing to say is a big part of this

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,080
dynamic is basically about two different

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,040
mentalities and attitudes towards wealth building

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,640
that differ across generations.

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,400
So my parents generation,

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,280
my parents are born in the late fifties, early sixties.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
They were part of a generation

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,600
which was unusually able to buy property

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,040
with the money they made from working.

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,400
Back in those periods of time,

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,840
the average property was only sort of two

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,680
or three times income in many places.

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,840
Interest rates were high,

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
you could save up money, build some interest,

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,360
buy property relatively easily.

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,920
So these people lived in a world

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,520
where if you were willing to, sort of,

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,680
work hard and save up, you could buy property.

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,000
The world has changed a lot since then

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,240
and younger people nowadays live in a world where it's increasingly

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,320
almost impossible to buy property without a big inheritance

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,200
from your parents.

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,240
So what this means is

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,000
there's a kind of a disconnect

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,120
in understanding between generations here.

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,040
Which is the older generation, which still owns,

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
in many cases, a decent chunk of wealth in terms of housing.

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
They think that the younger generation

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,920
will be able to buy their own homes,

47
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,280
but that is effectively impossible.

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,480
So what that means is

49
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,120
the older generation is thinking, well,

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,360
I'm going to use this money to,

51
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,120
you know, basically pay for my my end of life care,

52
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,080
hoping that,

53
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,400
you know,

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,640
and their retirements, hoping that the younger generation

55
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,080
will be able to buy properties on the back of their own work

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
which is impossible.

57
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,280
So what you then have is the older generation

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
releasing the equity in their homes,

59
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,000
selling their homes, using equity release schemes

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,720
in order to pay

61
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,800
for their retirements, pay for their end of life care,

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,520
thinking that their kids will be alright

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,960
because they can buy their own homes and then the kids

64
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,120
can't buy their own homes essentially.

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,280
And the kids are left in a situation

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
where the only way to buy a home

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
is to take out a really enormous mortgage

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
or basically to rent for their whole lives.

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
So I should add, you know, my grandparents,

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,960
all of them own their own property,

71
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,440
and they've all passed away now,

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,960
and none of them were able

73
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,640
to pass significant amounts of equity down

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,600
because that money was basically

75
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
all used to pay for their end of life care.

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,040
Increasingly, elderly people are living into their nineties.

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
They have to pay for end of life care for a long period of time.

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
It's very expensive

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
and this is essentially the way in

80
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,640
which ordinary people are losing their houses.

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,680
But, the question I always ask is, you know,

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
the amount of housing is not decreasing.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,480
The amount of debt adds up to zero.

84
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,240
So if ordinary families are owning less homes,

85
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,400
using more debt,

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,280
that can only mean that the rich are owning more homes

87
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,240
and having increasingly large amounts of money owed to them.

88
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,960
So in a sense,

89
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
the lack of home ownership

90
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,520
and the increased indebtedness of ordinary families

91
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,760
is a manifestation is in fact the exact mirror

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,240
image of this rapidly growing wealth of the very rich,

93
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,560
of the very rich that I talk about.

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,880
So, you know,

95
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,280
I think maybe people sometimes think I'm just sort of hate

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
rich people.

97
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,120
I am a rich person. I don't hate rich people.

98
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,080
But if you are allowing the wealth of the rich to grow enormously

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,320
at a time when the economy is not growing,

100
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,600
the only way that that can happen

101
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,720
is that the wealth of the middle classes

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,960
is being moved over to the rich.

103
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,360
And that can only happen if ordinary people are losing their homes.

104
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,960
And, you know,

105
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,720
I wanted to connect this to, we’ve

106
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,880
been speaking a little bit about tax in some of our shorts.

107
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,800
The reality of the situation is

108
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
most ordinary families

109
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,560
are going to lose a significant chunks of their

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,600
property wealth in order to pay for end of life care.

111
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,880
And through that mechanism, ordinary families will become poorer.

112
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,160
They'll lose their assets.

113
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,920
You know, one alternative to this would be to tax very rich people

114
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,600
who are seeing the biggest

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,080
and fastest

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
ever increases in their wealth in history,

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,520
tax them more to pay for a government funded care service.

118
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,360
And then in that case,

119
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,080
your dad, your grandad, you know,

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
you yourself, when you’re old wouldn’t

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,880
need to sell your home

122
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,120
in order to be able to live a dignified life in old age.

123
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,920
So I think people often instinctively think we need to reduce tax

124
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,200
to protect my wealth.

125
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,520
But we do have an alternative,

126
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,800
which is tax the people who are increasingly

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,520
going to own your wealth to pay for the things that you need.

128
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,800
I think we need to address the reality of the situation here,

129
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,520
which is

130
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,880
ordinary families are losing their wealth.

131
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,520
Rich people are gaining it.

132
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
And tax can be used

133
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320
as a defense, as an alternative, basically, you know.

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,480
If we tax the wealth back

135
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,400
from the people who are taking your wealth,

136
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,080
we can use that to give you the things you need,

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,240
which you will otherwise have to sell your home to afford.

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,520
You know, I talk about a lot on this channel.

139
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
It's very important to understand the flows of wealth, understand

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
which groups are getting richer,

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,720
which groups are getting poorer

142
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,520
at the moment is ordinary families

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,000
who over

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
the generations are getting poorer, generation after generation,

145
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,320
going further into debt and in fewer houses

146
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,600
and having lower standards of living.

147
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,680
That wealth is going to the rich.

148
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,120
The only way to reverse that is to tax the rich more.

149
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
We're going to campaign for more on this channel.

150
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Tell your friends, tell your family, send the video to your mum,

151
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,480
and hopefully we can make a change. Thank you.
