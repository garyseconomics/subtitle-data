00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,840
Today we are going to talk about asset price inflation.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,080
So the main thing I want to explain

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,400
today is the difference

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,040
between asset price inflation

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,720
and goods and services inflation,

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,480
which you might call shop price inflation and why it is important.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,640
The first obvious thing to say

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
is the rate at which asset price increases

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,360
is not always the same as the rate

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,240
at which prices in the shops increase.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,280
And in general, in the last 20, 30 years,

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,040
there's been a significant trend for assets

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,040
to increase more quickly than

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,080
goods and service prices, and also wages,

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,640
which has, of course, made housing less affordable.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,600
The first thing you need to know

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,560
is in the main measures of inflation,

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,320
which you will see on the news.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,000
The most well known one is CPI,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,440
consumer price inflation.

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,800
But you might also see RPI, retail price inflation.

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,280
These measures of inflation

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
only look at the prices of goods in the shops,

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,040
the regular things that you buy

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,960
and also services, transport,

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
basically your regular expenditures,

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,080
but they do not look at asset prices.

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,920
So these measures of inflation

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,120
do not look at asset prices,

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,120
which means that these measures of inflation,

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,720
I would argue

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,600
they basically underestimate actual inflation

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,720
because I think house prices and other asset

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,440
prices are a part of inflation.

36
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,760
But these are only looking at prices in the shops

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,520
which are going up more slowly.

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,560
So the second thing is

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,360
in my opinion,

40
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,800
there is a structural tendency in our economy

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,760
for asset prices to go up more quickly

42
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,720
than shop prices.

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,920
And the reason for this is, in my opinion,

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,120
growing inequality.

45
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,760
Now, I have looked at this for a very, very long time.

46
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,360
This is actually what I wrote my thesis on at Oxford,

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,720
which is on my website if you want to look at it,

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,480
I'll put a link in the comments.

49
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,600
The reason for that is very simple.

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,320
So ordinary people

51
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,080
spend almost all of the income

52
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,360
they receive in their lifetime.

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,480
This means that over the course of their life,

54
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,600
everything they receive,

55
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,760
they spend on goods and services.

56
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,400
Rich people act very differently.

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,480
They spend the majority of their

58
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,200
income on buying assets.

59
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
The richer you are,

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
the greater percentage of your income

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,760
you are likely to spend on assets

62
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,600
and the lower percentage of your income

63
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,360
you're likely to spend on goods and services.

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,400
So as an economy becomes more wealth unequal,

65
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,360
what you then have is a greater share of the assets

66
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,800
and a greater share of the purchasing power

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,040
being held by the rich and the very rich,

68
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,800
and a smaller share of the assets

69
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,840
and the purchasing power being held by ordinary people.

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Since ordinary people

71
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,160
like goods and services and rich people like assets,

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,280
as the economy becomes more and more equal,

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
the society as a whole will start to desire more assets

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,640
and desire less goods and services, which means that

75
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,960
asset prices tend to increase

76
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,600
relative to wages over time.

77
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,400
This makes housing increasingly unaffordable

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,440
over time in a way

79
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
that basically tends

80
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,160
to get often ignored by economists,

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,120
because economists focus only on

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,040
shop price inflation, CPI inflation.

83
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,680
So housing just gets more and more unaffordable

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,920
and basically nothing gets done about it.

85
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,160
The next thing you need to understand

86
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,120
is that central banks

87
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,280
such as the Bank of England here in the UK

88
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,600
or the Federal Reserve in the US,

89
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,680
they try to keep inflation at a 2% level,

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
but when they talk about inflation,

91
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
they are only looking at

92
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,400
shop price inflation, wage inflation.

93
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
They are not talking about inflation.

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
So basically the central bank,

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
not only is it doing

96
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,440
nothing to

97
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,120
stop housing from becoming more unaffordable,

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,040
in a sense it's exacerbating the problem

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
because while they

100
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,520
almost completely ignore rising

101
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,720
asset prices, rising house prices,

102
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,600
they are pretty much refusing to allow wages to rise

103
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,920
more than 2% or 2.5% a year.

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,600
So this creates a structural problem.

105
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
We have a system

106
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,240
in which

107
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,440
it is almost inevitable

108
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,080
that housing will become more expensive over time

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,960
and we are not allowing wages to rise.

110
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,560
So we can kind of see inevitably

111
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
this gap will increase.

112
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,600
But we have a double problem.

113
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,720
So as house prices go up and wages

114
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,080
don't go up as quickly,

115
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,440
there's only basically two ways to fix this problem.

116
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,800
One is more rapid increases in wages,

117
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,760
which the central banks won't allow,

118
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,040
and one is falls in house prices.

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,120
So if you have rapid falls in house prices,

120
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,880
which is what we would need

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,960
to make housing significantly more expensive,

122
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,920
this causes massive problems, essentially.

123
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,480
We see these kinds of collapses.

124
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,120
People buy houses with big mortgages.

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
So if your house price suddenly collapses,

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,520
you are basically immediately bankrupt

127
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,280
because you've bought a half million

128
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,920
pound house, you borrowed £450,000.

129
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,120
Now your house is worth only £300.

130
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,280
Your net worth is -150.

131
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,320
So people immediately become bankrupted

132
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,760
and it can cause massive economic problems.

133
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,840
So basically, we've created an unfixable problem.

134
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,600
We need wages to go up, central bank won’t allow it.

135
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,520
We need house prices to come down.

136
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,840
If house prices come down quickly,

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,160
it causes an economic collapse,

138
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,080
causes people to be bankrupted.

139
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,600
So the situation is essentially unfixable.

140
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,480
And I think the way that you fix

141
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,840
it is basically to understand that inflation is not one

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,920
single measure, right?

143
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,880
It's not just simply CPI.

144
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,840
What you have is three different things, essentially.

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,200
I think three different main categories of inflation

146
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,680
you want to look at, which is goods

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,760
and service inflation.

148
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,680
And within that we can divide luxury goods

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,080
and services and essential goods and services,

150
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
wage inflation and asset

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,480
inflation like house prices inflation.

152
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Now, the kind of inflation

153
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,680
that we've had in the last four or five years

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,360
is basically the worst possible kind of inflation.

155
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,160
It's been driven

156
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
primarily by

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,880
goods and services,

158
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,280
especially basic essentials like food and energy.

159
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
Wages have lagged behind,

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
which means ordinary people's

161
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,680
living conditions have fallen,

162
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
and yet houses

163
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,360
have become extremely more expensive in that period.

164
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,240
So it is the worst possible

165
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,680
combination of inflation for ordinary people.

166
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,040
But it's probably worth bearing in mind

167
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,640
that it's a really good combination

168
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,200
for people who own assets and consume labour.

169
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
So if you're a very wealthy person,

170
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,200
you own a load of assets,

171
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,120
you own a lot of natural resources,

172
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,640
and what you do is you consume other people's labour,

173
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
then your situation is great

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,800
because the things you own have become more expensive

175
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,760
and the workers

176
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
who you might use to do your goods and...

177
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,400
to do your services have become cheaper.

178
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,120
In a sense, it's a kind of a

179
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,920
you could describe it as a class warfare

180
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
kind of inflation.

181
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
And we've kind of built that into the system

182
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,360
we have baked into our system

183
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
a kind of inflation where assets,

184
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,560
which is a measure of the power of the rich, continue

185
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,080
to become more expensive,

186
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,160
whereas wages,

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
which is a measure of the power of ordinary people,

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,320
are basically not allowed to go up by the central bank.

189
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,760
I think it should be obvious

190
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,680
the best way to fix

191
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
the housing crisis is to stabilise

192
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,040
house prices and encourage specifically wage inflation.

193
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,320
Now, there is no other way to make housing affordable.

194
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,440
And I would encourage economists to think about this.

195
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,720
It's the only way to fix it, really.

196
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,360
You need to get wages to go up.

197
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,840
I think the best way to make wages

198
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,680
go up and house prices not go up

199
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,280
is to move that spending power back.

200
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,480
Ordinary people buy goods and services.

201
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,600
You as a worker, produce goods and services.

202
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,560
If you get money into the hands of ordinary people,

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
they will buy the stuff you produce

204
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
and your wages will go up.

205
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,440
If instead we put all the money

206
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
in the hands of the rich.

207
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,960
They will buy assets. They will buy your houses.

208
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,320
Housing will become more expensive

209
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
and they will become stronger.

210
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,880
You will become weaker and you will lose your house.

211
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
So that's it, basically.

212
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,600
To conclude, there's not just one measure of inflation.

213
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,320
Asset inflation is very important,

214
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
the kind of inflation on the news

215
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
only ever looks at goods and services

216
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,080
and wage inflation is important as well.

217
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,480
Secondly, not all kinds of inflation are bad

218
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,400
If your wages are going up

219
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
faster than the price of goods and services

220
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
and faster than the price of housing,

221
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
your life will get better.

222
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
If housing and goods and services

223
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,640
are going up faster than the price of your wages,

224
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,280
your life will get worse.

225
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
I want your life to get better.

226
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,680
So let's ask for higher wages

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,880
and let's not accept the myth

228
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,320
in the media that if your wages go up, it's bad.

229
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,240
Pretty obviously your wage going up is good,

230
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,600
especially if they're going up faster than house

231
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
prices and goods and services.

232
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,320
And the way to do that

233
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
is to take purchasing power away from the rich,

234
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,920
put it in the hands of ordinary people.

235
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,200
And the way to achieve that is to tax the rich more

236
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
and to tax you and ordinary working people less.

237
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,920
We campaign for that on this channel every week.

238
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,960
Send the video to your friends,

239
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,120
send the video to your Mum.

240
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,200
Thanks for your support. Take care.
