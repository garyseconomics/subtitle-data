1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,360
Cool.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,160
Just do a quick sound check. One two. One two. One two.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,760
That's good.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,760
Whenever you’re ready.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,120
We’re good, yeah?

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah, good.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Right.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,240
All right.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,720
We're going to do a video about the election.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,360
To be honest,

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,120
I didn't really want to do a video about the election

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,480
because the election is very often so much bullsh*t.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,000
We get everybody

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,320
very, very excited, and then,

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,240
nothing changes and people get quite depressed.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,280
As you know, this channel is an economics channel,

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
and we have a very clear message

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,280
and a very clear idea on this channel, which is that

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,720
inequality, specifically

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,400
inequality of wealth is growing and growing,

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,440
that is causing falls

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,480
in living standards for ordinary families,

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,200
which you can see.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
And it's going to get worse and worse.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,840
And we need to change that.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,480
people often ask me, why don't you get into politics?

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,160
And, when people say that to me,

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,240
I always say the same thing, which is I'm in politics.

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm in politics.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,840
I often ask them, you know, Rupert Murdoch,

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,800
you know, is he in politics?

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,920
So Rupert Murdoch, for people

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,200
who don't know

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,600
he owns, he's a very, very, very wealthy Australian

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,080
who owns a lot of newspapers,

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,480
a lot of TV channels

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,520
here in the UK, also in Australia,

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,320
I think in the US as well, all across the world.

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,800
And,

40
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,240
he basically tries to convince people

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,160
to hate foreigners and not tax rich people.

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,320
And it's something he's been very successful at.

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,440
And, he controls a lot of politicians and politicians

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,520
do what he says

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,480
because he controls

46
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,920
what people think and who people vote for.

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,920
So

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,760
the first thing to say is

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,680
we're going to get a new prime minister

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,760
early next month.

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,840
Rishi Sunak,

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,320
the current prime minister, has called an election.

53
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
He will lose that election.

54
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,840
And Keir Starmer,

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,560
the head of the Labour Party,

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,960
will become prime minister on July 4th.

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,600
A lot of people will be very excited about that.

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
That's understandable.

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,440
The Conservatives have been in power for 14 years now.

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,880
I was a very young man when they took power.

61
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,120
They've overseen, enormous increase in inequality.

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
They've overseen an enormous increase in poverty.

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,680
they've overseen an enormous fall in living standards.

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,240
In many cases, most of the senior

65
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
politicians, Conservative

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,080
politicians are very, very wealthy people from very,

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
very wealthy backgrounds.

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
In particular, Rishi Sunak

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
is an extremely wealthy man

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,000
from an extremely wealthy family.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
I've been criticising him

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
ever since he became chancellor

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,480
because he has consistently brought in policies

74
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,080
which have enriched the richest,

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
that have increased inequality

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,120
and, in my opinion, have been the source

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,160
of falling living standards in this country.

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,320
So you might think

79
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,760
I would

80
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,240
be absolutely delighted

81
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,480
at the fact that

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
the Conservatives are going to be voted out.

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,320
there's a good chance they will not only be voted out,

84
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,880
but they will

85
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,520
lose very badly, that they will lose

86
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,640
a lot of seats, that a lot of famous

87
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,000
MPs will lose their seats.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,120
And a lot of people

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,480
on the left are understandably very excited about that.

90
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,080
And, you know,

91
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,040
I would like to be excited about it as well.

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,200
Don't get me wrong,

93
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,840
I will probably enjoy

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,160
watching Rishi Sunak lose, and it would be nice

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,200
if some big Conservative MPs who have

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,680
consistently opposed tax on the rich lose their seats.

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,920
But it's very hard for me to be excited

98
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,040
because I don't think we will see

99
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,120
any improvements in living standards

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
and

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,320
I think that there's

102
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,120
a tendency,

103
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,320
an understandable tendency

104
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,520
to see politics as a bit like football.

105
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,560
You know, I support this political team.

106
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,320
You support that political team.

107
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,600
I want your political team to lose,

108
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,400
I want my political team to win.

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
But my background is not politics.

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,080
My background is economics,

111
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,720
and my background is a trader.

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,920
And what I am worried about

113
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,000
is the continual collapse in living standards.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't think we will change that

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,640
unless you do something about inequality.

116
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,040
we need to stop it from rising.

117
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
It is rising very quickly.

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
If we don't take action on that

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,920
living standards will continue to fall.

120
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,440
And my honest opinion,

121
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,240
unfortunately, is that the new government,

122
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
that the new Labour government

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,760
will not take action on that,

124
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,720
they will not stop inequality from rising.

125
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,800
They will not stop living standards from falling.

126
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,480
So it's really difficult for me to be excited,

127
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,240
about the election.

128
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,920
So the first message I want to put across is

129
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,120
don't get too excited.

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,920
There's going to be a lot...

131
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,480
I say that,

132
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,160
I think a lot of people won't be excited anyway,

133
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,840
because I think people won't have high expectations.

134
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,320
There'll be a lot of political coverage on the news.

135
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
the Conservatives will lose.

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,920
They'll probably lose by quite a lot.

137
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,520
We'll get a Labour government.

138
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,160
Don't raise your hopes too much,

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
because I worry when we see things like this,

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,320
everybody gets very excited.

141
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,720
Everybody hopes are more. Everybody expects change.

142
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,400
And then when change doesn't come, people

143
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,240
become disappointed, people become despondent,

144
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,400
people become depressed,

145
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
and people start to completely lose

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
faith in the status quo in what's happening.

147
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
This election, in my opinion, is not

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,200
the big fight.

149
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,720
So let’s talk about why.

150
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,400
But before I do that, I want to say as well,

151
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,480
please avoid the excessive

152
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,840
football-ification of politics.

153
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,840
I view politics through the lens of the economy.

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,920
My view on the economy at the moment is that

155
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,560
it is collapsing.

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
From the perspective of living

157
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,640
standards of ordinary people, that's not going to stop.

158
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,600
The only way to stop that, in

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
my opinion, is for ordinary people to unite and agree

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,640
that we need to take action, stopping

161
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,200
the increasing exploding wealth of the very rich

162
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,080
and the transfer of wealth

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,600
from ordinary people to the very rich.

164
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
When we divide

165
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,320
ordinary working people into red and blue and yellow,

166
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,680
it often makes it harder to achieve that unity.

167
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
So don't allow this election

168
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,480
to create more division between ordinary people.

169
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,440
That being said,

170
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,480
we need to do some analysis of the election itself.

171
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
So let's get started.

172
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
So the first thing is the calling

173
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,160
of the election itself. And this is

174
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,440
quite, quite funny in a way.

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,600
We put a video out a few weeks ago

176
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,960
predicting that inflation would fall in this country

177
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,560
for really obvious reasons.

178
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
You know, it's a good video.

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Go back and watch it.

180
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,320
I think it's called

181
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,400
predicting inflation

182
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,120
or why inflation will fall this week.

183
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,800
We'll put a link in the description.

184
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,840
And in that video we said that

185
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,880
almost certainly the official inflation

186
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
statistic for the country

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
would fall significantly this month.

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,960
It was extremely predictable.

189
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,920
It was for historical reasons.

190
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
But we knew that the government

191
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,320
tried to take credit for it.

192
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,920
And, I honestly think that is the reason

193
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,960
they've called this election.

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,280
if you go back and look at that video,

195
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,840
we explain that inflation was bountiful this month.

196
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
It will probably fall again slightly next month,

197
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,360
and then it will start to rise after that.

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,440
So if we have an election on

199
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,040
July the 4th, which we will,

200
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,360
we will have just seen a couple

201
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,720
of inflation statistics prints which look really good

202
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
for the government.

203
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
And we won't yet

204
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
have had the inflation starting to rise again.

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
The Conservatives and Rishi

206
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,360
Sunak are currently very unpopular,

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,800
but here is this one statistic,

208
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,920
which they have tried to claim aggressive credit for.

209
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,880
Inflation is coming down.

210
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
It will probably come down again

211
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,000
in the print this month.

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
They want to claim credit for that.

213
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,560
And I think they've decided that

214
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
this is kind of the only good news story

215
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,640
that they've got.

216
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,800
So let's run with it.

217
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,760
Let's call it an election

218
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,200
while inflation is low and let’s hope people will

219
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,800
vote for us.

220
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,920
But not a lot of people are going to vote for them,

221
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,440
which is largely

222
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,280
because living standards

223
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,000
have really significantly collapsed

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,520
under their government.

225
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,800
So, you know, I follow the betting odds quite closely.

226
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,520
It's almost certain

227
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,800
the Conservatives will lose and Labour win,

228
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,080
Labour will win an overall majority.

229
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,680
it could be a pretty significant overall majority. And,

230
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,960
different people have different opinions

231
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,600
on why that is.

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,800
But I think that is almost exclusively

233
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,440
because living standards have fallen so much,

234
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
and it's been 14 years of Conservative government.

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,960
People can see that life is getting harder.

236
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,840
People want change.

237
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,640
I don't think there's a lot of particular enthusiasm

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
for the Labour Party.

239
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
But here in the United Kingdom,

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,600
we have a first past the post political system,

241
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,440
which I can discuss a little bit more,

242
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,760
perhaps in another video.

243
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,880
It basically means that similarly to the US,

244
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,160
we have a two party system

245
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,960
where it's almost impossible for any party

246
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,440
other than the two major parties to take power.

247
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,240
So if you don't like the Conservatives,

248
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,840
if you're not happy with the falling living standards,

249
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,960
you basically have no choice other than Labour.

250
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,040
The Conservatives and Rishi

251
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,360
Sunak are extremely unpopular,

252
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,400
so we're going to get a

253
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,720
probably a significantly large Labour majority

254
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,480
in this government.

255
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,400
What does that mean?

256
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,720
You know,

257
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,760
I've got here on my list

258
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,520
to go through the policies of the parties, but,

259
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,000
you know,

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,640
you're going to get the policies of the parties

261
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,920
and the manifestos of the parties

262
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,560
rammed down your neck on BBC news and Sky news

263
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,080
as if they're important, as if they matter.

264
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,760
To be honest, they don't really matter.

265
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,920
They're going to make a lot of promises.

266
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
They're going to promise to cut your taxes.

267
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,400
They're going to promise to do loads of amazing things,

268
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,240
which they basically can't pay for

269
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,560
because I don't think you can fund these things

270
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
if you're not willing to raise taxes on the rich.

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,320
So it's a lot of pie in the sky policy.

272
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,320
Really, you've got two

273
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,280
parties that are promising to continue

274
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,560
pretty much the economic status quo.

275
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,960
You probably get a little bit more austerity

276
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,680
under the Conservatives,

277
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,280
which would probably be worse,

278
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,480
but I think

279
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,280
Labour have not really offered us anything significant.

280
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
You know, behind the scenes,

281
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,360
I talk to Labour politicians

282
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,680
and I try to lobby Labour politicians

283
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,840
to do more on inequality,

284
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,520
but basically we have not done enough

285
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,880
and we're not going to get enough,

286
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,160
when I ask Labour politicians

287
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,720
why you're not taking action on inequality,

288
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,920
why are you not taxing very rich people?

289
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,080
Some of them say we would like to do it,

290
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,800
but we don't think it's a vote winner.

291
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,120
For me, that's quite depressing

292
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,840
because this is what I tried to do on this channel.

293
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
The whole point of this channel

294
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,080
is for me to convince you

295
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,760
that the only way to stop the fall in living

296
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,800
standards is to stop the increase in inequality.

297
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,840
The only way to stop the increasing

298
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,120
inequality is to significantly

299
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,520
increase taxes on the rich,

300
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,440
so that we can cut tax on ordinary people.

301
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,640
And unfortunately,

302
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,800
both the major political parties at this point in time

303
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
don't think that's a vote winner.

304
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,280
So that's a failure for me and that's a failure for us.

305
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,760
But the truth of the matter is,

306
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,640
I never thought that we would win

307
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,840
anything in this election.

308
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,320
I was expecting the election to be the end of the year.

309
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,920
October, November.

310
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,240
I've been trying to really aggressively

311
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,960
grow this channel,

312
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,360
but it was never really to target this year's election

313
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,040
because I never thought

314
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,480
we would get much from this year's election.

315
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
But there is

316
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,360
one small shrapnel of hope,

317
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,080
something that we can be proud of,

318
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,760
that I can be proud of, that you can be proud of,

319
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,720
which is that the Green Party has adopted our call.

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,080
The Green Party has adopted basically, exactly

321
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,760
what I've been campaigning for,

322
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,280
which is a 1% tax on wealth

323
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,400
and wealth of about £10 million.

324
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
That's something that I'm proud of.

325
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,320
It's something that you can be proud of.

326
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,080
Anyone who watches this channel,

327
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,160
he supports this channel who

328
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
helps to grow this channel.

329
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,160
It is, of course, not just because of me.

330
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,840
You know, there's a lot of groups that I work with

331
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,400
that have been campaigning for this as well.

332
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,040
There's the Patriotic Millionaires who have done

333
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,800
amazing work.

334
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,000
Rebecca Gowland who runs that organisation, has done

335
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,520
an amazing work, and all of the millionaires

336
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,560
who are part of that group have done

337
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,080
amazing work campaigning for it.

338
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,000
Tax Justice UK

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,760
have been campaigning for the same thing.

340
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,120
Economists like Arun Advani

341
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,840
at Warwick have been campaigning for the same thing.

342
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,680
And we've got it

343
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,280
into the Green manifesto, into the Green policy,

344
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,800
which is something we should be proud of.

345
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,760
And, you know, I'm really grateful

346
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,920
for everyone who's pushed for it,

347
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,800
and I'm grateful for the Greens

348
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
putting it in their manifesto.

349
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,520
The reality is the Greens are,

350
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,680
of course, not going to get into power

351
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,080
in this election.

352
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,720
The nature of our political system,

353
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,840
basically, it's a two party job.

354
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,960
And, it's very, very difficult to shift that.

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,160
But if the Greens do well,

356
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,240
if the Greens get more votes,

357
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,200
in the best case scenario,

358
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
they could win a couple more seats.

359
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,520
It is a message that people are willing

360
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,360
to accept these kinds of policies. So,

361
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll be voting for the Greens, and,

362
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm not going to tell you guys who to vote for, but,

363
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,000
these guys have adopted

364
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,280
what we've been campaigning for.

365
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,560
The reality is they're not going to win.

366
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,480
But if they get a big vote, if they get a big...

367
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
if they get a couple more seats,

368
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,000
which in the best case they could, it is a good sign.

369
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,520
It is a good sign. So that's who I'll be voting for.

370
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,760
So what could happen? You know, the truth is,

371
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,840
I don't think this is going to be...

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,200
even though we might see like

373
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,640
a big political landslide,

374
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,040
a big collapse in the Conservatives

375
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,040
and a massive majority for Labour,

376
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,760
I don't think it really changes our game much,

377
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,720
because Labour are not really going

378
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,840
to give us the policies that we want.

379
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,200
The truth is, we might get a few more opportunities.

380
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,920
I put a video out

381
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,360
when Rishi Sunak became Conservative leader.

382
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,840
It's easy to forget this now,

383
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,560
but when Rishi Sunak became Conservative leader,

384
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,880
he had a really good brand.

385
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,120
He was considered to be really smart, really competent,

386
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
really good with money,

387
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
and a lot of people were really happy to see him

388
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,720
be prime minister.

389
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,680
And, I put a video out saying

390
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,240
Rishi Sunak will be phenomenally unpopular

391
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,840
in a year's time,

392
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,760
just basically, specifically

393
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
for the exact same reasons that I'm telling you

394
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,400
now that Keir Starmer will be very unpopular

395
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,040
in a year, year

396
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,600
and a half time

397
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
because Rishi Sunak did not take action on inequality,

398
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
which meant living standards continue to fall.

399
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,360
Keir Starmer looks like he's

400
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,200
not going to take action on inequality,

401
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,680
which means living standards will continue to fall.

402
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,760
So,

403
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,680
Rishi Sunak's popularity collapsed,

404
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,960
but that really never gave us any opportunities

405
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,920
because I've never once been contacted

406
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,800
by a Conservative MP on the work that I do.

407
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
If a Labour win

408
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,240
a year, two years, three years

409
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
into a Labour government,

410
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,280
if living standards have not recovered,

411
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,880
which they won't,

412
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,080
Keir Starmer will be very unpopular.

413
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,600
There might be demand for change and for new policies.

414
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
If we can keep growing what we're doing,

415
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,880
we can try and get ourselves

416
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,680
to be the big voice in the room, when that happens.

417
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,920
There's a quote by the famous,

418
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,520
very right

419
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,640
wing American economist

420
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,480
Milton Friedman, which is, at times of crisis,

421
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,880
the new solution will be chosen

422
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,680
from the ideas lying around at the time.

423
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,720
Of what you can see

424
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
from the way the two main parties

425
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,800
have gone into this election is that we,

426
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,760
me, this idea that the problem is inequality

427
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,680
is not the loudest idea lying around at the time.

428
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,440
To be honest, if you look at the

429
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,120
the policies of the two main parties,

430
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,760
it seems like

431
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,280
there is no idea lying around because they don't

432
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,440
basically don't seem to be offering anything,

433
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,880
anything new on the economy.

434
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,120
The biggest new idea,

435
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,720
which is starting to get popular about the economy,

436
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,320
you can see the Conservatives edging that way.

437
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,120
You can see it becoming popular across Europe

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,520
and also in the US

439
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,280
is that the problem is immigrants,

440
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,640
is that the problem is foreigners.

441
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,360
You know, this is a really popular

442
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
economic idea, especially at times of crisis.

443
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,680
It was really popular in the early 20th century.

444
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,520
It was a big part of the reason of why

445
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,960
we ended up getting the Second World War.

446
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,520
Why we ended up getting the

447
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,720
Holocaust, things like this.

448
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,000
we need to make

449
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
our idea big enough

450
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
such that when the next election comes around,

451
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,120
the two main parties can't ignore it.

452
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,440
That's what I think, basically.

453
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,320
And I think this election

454
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,640
as much as it's fantastic

455
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,480
that the Greens have taken up our ideas.

456
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,440
The Greens are not going to get into power.

457
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,200
We need to win that argument for ideas.

458
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,280
We need to win the argument

459
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,320
for ideas for the next election.

460
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,840
I think that's all we can do.

461
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,280
That's all we can do.

462
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,000
I think,

463
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
I love football

464
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
and I love politics

465
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,320
for a similar reason that I love football

466
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,240
because I just...

467
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm kind of a geeky guy

468
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,520
that likes these kinds of things. And,

469
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,440
a couple of years ago,

470
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,840
I had a two year plan for this channel,

471
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,400
which was to grow it massively.

472
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,600
And the book was part of that.

473
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,320
And,

474
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,160
it's been massively successful,

475
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,480
the growth of this channel has been enormous.

476
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,040
the growth of these ideas have been enormous.

477
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
The fact that we're getting these ideas

478
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
more understood,

479
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,760
more recognised by politicians,

480
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,800
by ordinary people, is partly

481
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,440
thanks to the work that I've done

482
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,280
and the work that you've done, sharing this.

483
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,160
I was kind of working towards

484
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,760
the end of the year as my time horizon,

485
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,880
and even though I knew we weren't

486
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
going to win anything from the election,

487
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,680
you're kind of thinking

488
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,320
maybe we can get ourselves a voice.

489
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,000
Maybe we can get ourselves a voice.

490
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,360
the election got called earlier,

491
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,680
and we're not in a position

492
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,280
to influence the main political parties.

493
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,880
And,

494
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
I think it's hard when you work so hard at something.

495
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,760
And you, you see how far you've come on it,

496
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,240
and you look up and you see how much further

497
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,280
you have to go on that thing.

498
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,840
So basically,

499
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,200
living standards are not going to rise

500
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
after this election.

501
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,640
We'll get a new government.

502
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,280
They're not going to do anything on inequality.

503
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,600
But, you know,

504
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,840
I never thought we would get anything

505
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,200
from the Conservatives,

506
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,400
and I never thought we would get anything from Labour.

507
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,560
And before I started this YouTube channel,

508
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,480
I existed in the world of, like, think tanks

509
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,560
and newspapers.

510
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,080
And I spoke to politicians,

511
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,280
and I spoke to people who speak to politicians,

512
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,240
and I still speak to people

513
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
who speak to politicians now.

514
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,720
And I made the intentional choice

515
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,840
to stop speaking to politicians

516
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,000
and start speaking to you

517
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
because I don't think that the politicians

518
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
are going to save us.

519
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,680
I think that we have to save us.

520
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,040
And, I think if enough of you realise that what we need

521
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,360
is action on inequality,

522
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,320
what we need is a fairer tax system

523
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,880
that taxes the rich more and taxes working people less.

524
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,640
I honestly believe

525
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,120
we can get ourselves into a situation

526
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,880
where when we go into an election,

527
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
the political parties have to do something.

528
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,280
And, you know, this might sound an absurd comparison,

529
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,720
but in a weird way,

530
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,960
I sometimes take hope from Brexit because in 2015,

531
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,440
none of the major political parties supported Brexit.

532
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,360
They were all quite passionately against it.

533
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
And

534
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,480
people consistently voted for parties

535
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,920
that were pro-Brexit to the point

536
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,360
where now the main political parties,

537
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,480
they don't want to support Brexit,

538
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,600
but they have to support Brexit

539
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
and you know,

540
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't necessarily think Brexit is going to save us,

541
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
and I don't think Brexit necessarily

542
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
is going to get us out of this problem.

543
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,480
But what it shows is if enough ordinary people

544
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,040
demand something, we do still live in a democracy

545
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,960
and the politicians

546
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
will eventually have to give us that. But,

547
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,400
we're not loud enough.

548
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,880
My voice is not loud enough.

549
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,840
Your voice is not loud enough.

550
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,320
but it was always going to be a marathon, not a sprint.

551
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,280
I'll be voting for the one party

552
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,720
that has supported my ideas.

553
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,960
I think the first past the post

554
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,400
political system is stupid.

555
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,960
I'll be swapping my vote

556
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,360
if it helps on vote swapping websites.

557
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
Listen, there'll be people that will say

558
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,440
don't vote for the Greens because you need to vote for

559
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
whoever will get the Tories out.

560
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,640
And that's a legitimate opinion.

561
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,720
And if that's what you want to do, you can do that.

562
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,920
I will swap my vote so that I can try and do both.

563
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,600
I would encourage you to do what you think is best,

564
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,280
but also to realise,

565
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,360
don't get caught up in the hype of this election.

566
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,520
The real battle for living

567
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,040
standards is a battle for distribution.

568
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,880
It's a battle for inequality.

569
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,240
It's a battle which unfortunately, at the moment,

570
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,680
none of the politicians are fighting for us.

571
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,840
I'm going to keep fighting.

572
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,160
Well, I'm going to take a holiday, actually,

573
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,960
because I need one.

574
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,680
But, when I come back, I'll be fighting.

575
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,640
And, I hope you guys will fight with me.

576
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,560
So

577
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,240
don't worry too much about Rishi

578
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
Sunak and Keir Starmer.

579
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,840
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

580
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,480
I'll keep going and I hope you guys come with me.

581
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
So thanks for your support. And, we'll keep going.

582
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,840
Thank you.

583
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,080
Happy with that? Yeah, great man, it's great.

584
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,480
Emotional. Yeah.

585
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,400
It is frustrating, isn't it? You know, it just.

586
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,040
Yeah.

587
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,240
It's hard when you realise, like, f*****g

588
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,880
how much you have to work and how much harder,

589
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,800
how much more you have to come still, you know.

590
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,080
You know what I'll do.

591
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,520
And you know, you can stick this in on the end

592
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,960
if you want. Like I'm in a safe Labour seat.

593
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,760
I will try and swap a Green vote into a seat

594
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,440
that the Greens are challenging for.

595
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,000
probably they won't want to swap with me

596
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,720
because

597
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,560
people all over the country will be trying to swap into

598
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,680
about four Green seats, right.

599
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,920
So what I'll probably do is I'll vote Green here

600
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,440
and I'll swap a Labour vote into a marginal.

601
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
Or I might even swap Lib-Dem vote into a marginal

602
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,000
to try and like you know

603
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,600
I don't, I don't want to see listen

604
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,640
there's people that will say

605
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
how can you support the Greens?

606
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,400
You've got to fight the Tories and that's it.

607
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,360
I don't disrespect that view.

608
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,440
And there are people who say,

609
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,200
how can you support Labour when they do this?

610
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,680
They do that.

611
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,880
And obviously I haven't mentioned things

612
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
they do outside of economics.

613
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
But I think you can get the sense

614
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,480
I'm disappointed in Labour

615
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,960
and I appreciate that point of view as well.

616
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,440
But I'll swap so I can try and fight both fights.

617
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,240
And also like

618
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm not going to insult people because,

619
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,960
you know, I think

620
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,200
both of those views are legitimate views.

621
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
I think if the Tories lose, which they do

622
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,920
and we get a big Labour majority,

623
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,840
we have a better chance than if the Tories don't lose.

624
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,040
You know,

625
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,600
I think if we get

626
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,760
a big Green vote

627
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,480
realistically,

628
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,160
that the press will ignore that big Green vote.

629
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,440
But if we get a big Green vote, it

630
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,800
at least is a signal,

631
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,960
you know, and one thing I will say.

632
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,760
I would encourage people to vote.

633
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,200
I would encourage people to vote.

634
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,680
And, if you can, you know, if it works for you, vote

635
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,400
because, you know,

636
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
a lot of poor people, a lot of young people don't vote.

637
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,120
And we get ignored.

638
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,840
And and I know a lot of people

639
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,760
are discouraged with Labour

640
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,000
and I'm discouraged with Labour.

641
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
But, you know,

642
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,000
and maybe some people

643
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,200
don't like the Greens for some reason.

644
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,400
I would encourage you to go and vote.

645
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,080
And, you know, if you

646
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,320
if that means voting for an independent,

647
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,280
if that means voting for Labour,

648
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,360
if that means voting for Greens,

649
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
if that means voting for the Lib Dems

650
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,800
or the SNP to get the Tories out of,

651
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,600
you'll see these are all legit views.

652
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
Like I don't want to see ordinary people

653
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,280
divided by like, oh,

654
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,560
my party is better than your party.

655
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,280
Like I just the situation is too serious for that,

656
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,720
the situation is too serious for that.

657
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
But more than anything.

658
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,800
This election is not the be all and end all, you know.

659
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,680
Go out, cast your vote, dust your hands off, move on.

660
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,360
Because we got a long, a lot of...

661
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
we have many years of fighting ahead of us,

662
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,000
and we can't afford to just, like,

663
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,760
exhaust ourselves all on this one thing. For sure.

664
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,200
Shall we just cut there?

665
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,600
Yeah, I think so, yes. Yeah. Sick that.
