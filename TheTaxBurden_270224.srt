00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Today we're going to talk about the tax burden.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
So this is an economic story

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,880
which comes up a lot in the news,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
which is the idea that at the moment

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,800
the tax burden is at an all time historic high.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,480
Now, I'm pretty sure this is

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,560
a basically a factual truth.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,720
And it's something that

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
when it first started to get mentioned, it

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
kind of confused me a little bit.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,640
And I think it will have confused a lot of people.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,800
The reason it confused me

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,360
is because we have two things happening simultaneously,

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,440
which kind of appear to be like

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,680
paradoxically impossible, which is, number one,

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,800
you have the tax burden at an all time high.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,600
And that's true.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,480
You guys will see that,

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,160
especially things like council tax

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,760
rising really significantly.

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
And at the same time, we have this situation

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,600
where basically all government services seem to be

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,840
collapsing simultaneously.

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,920
Everything seems to be constantly in crisis,

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,960
NHS is in crisis,

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,040
Education is in crisis,

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,920
especially things like local services are in crisis.

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,840
So how can it be possible that on the one hand

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,280
taxes are the highest they've ever been

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,920
and on the other hand,

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
government services are like the worst

33
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,600
they've ever been, or they've been in decades.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,240
Taxes pay for government services,

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,760
so if taxes are super high,

36
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,960
how can government services be super terrible? And

37
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,200
the reason which is often

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,880
given for this

39
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,720
and I think it's really increased

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,120
the popularity of the idea,

41
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,560
is basically that government is corrupt.

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,480
Government is corrupt, so we’re paying loads of taxes.

43
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,360
Government p*sses the taxes up the wall.

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,880
You know,

45
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,840
let's get rid of taxes,

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,560
let's get rid of government services.

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
And I think,

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,880
you know, there probably some truth to this.

49
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,760
I think there's probably always

50
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,600
been some degree of government corruption.

51
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Government corruption

52
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,680
may well be higher now than it has been historically.

53
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,880
If you look at some of the things that happened

54
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,080
during COVID,

55
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,320
some of the sort of Conservative Party

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
scandals, it does look like corruption is increasing.

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
But I'm not an expert

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
on the levels of government corruption.

59
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,600
I don't work in government.

60
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,320
But I've been sitting and

61
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,080
thinking about this for a while.

62
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,720
I don't think it's enough to say that

63
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,800
corruption has suddenly increased massively.

64
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,440
And

65
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,400
the more I thought about this,

66
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,120
the more I realised

67
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,680
there is another really obvious factor,

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
which basically never gets discussed,

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,800
which I want to explain to you today,

70
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,560
which explains really well basically why the tax burden

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,520
has increased

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,160
and probably will continue to increase

73
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,000
despite the fact that government services

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
are collapsing.

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
I think the best way to explain

76
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,880
this is to use an example.

77
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,240
Imagine you own completely your own house.

78
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,600
No mortgage, no rent, you own your own house.

79
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Some of you will be in that position.

80
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,680
Most of you won't be in that position.

81
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,640
Now, imagine you are in that position.

82
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,520
How expensive will your life be?

83
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
Well, for most people,

84
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,160
their housing cost is their single

85
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,760
biggest expense in their life.

86
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,000
Be that through paying rent or paying mortgage,

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,520
if you own your own house outright,

88
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,320
you don't need to pay rent,

89
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
you don't need to pay mortgage.

90
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,400
And basically your costs in life are

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,240
very low compared to somebody else.

92
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,640
Now, let's imagine

93
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,240
situation changes and suddenly you lose that house,

94
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,320
you completely lose that house,

95
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
and now you still need to leave,

96
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,240
but you don't own your house.

97
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Your costs will massively increase

98
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,240
because you have to pay rent for a whole house,

99
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,560
or you have to pay a mortgage on a whole house.

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
So if you own your house,

101
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
your expenditures in life are much lower

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,640
than if you don't own your own house.

103
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Now, keep this example in mind

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,160
and we're going to start thinking about the government.

105
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,840
So I talk a lot on this channel

106
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,560
about increases in inequality of wealth

107
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,400
and what I say very often is

108
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,040
that there are two groups in society

109
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
who are losing their wealth.

110
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,000
That is ordinary working families

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,480
like you, unless you’re very rich and the government.

112
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,240
And both of these groups

113
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,560
have lost their wealth significantly.

114
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Now, of course,

115
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
if you're an ordinary family,

116
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,440
especially if you're a young person

117
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,360
from from an ordinary family,

118
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,960
it would be very visible to you

119
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,440
that ordinary families are losing their wealth

120
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,680
because you'll be probably struggling to buy a home.

121
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,880
Or you may be in a situation

122
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,240
where you think you can never buy a home

123
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,960
compared to older generations, who could buy property.

124
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,160
But the loss of government

125
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,840
wealth is often a lot less visible because we don't,

126
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,800
you know, we are not the government,

127
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,040
we don't think about what the government owns.

128
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,920
So I went to a talk by famous French

129
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,080
inequality economist Thomas Piketty, of whom

130
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm quite a big fan,

131
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,200
a few years ago

132
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,560
when I was at Oxford and he showed us a graph

133
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
which I still remember today,

134
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,400
and we're going to show you that graph now,

135
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,880
which basically shows you government wealth holding.

136
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
So on this graph

137
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,320
you can see what percentage of the wealth,

138
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,240
the assets in society are owned by the government.

139
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,680
And I think this graph goes back to around about 1970.

140
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
So what you can see in this graph

141
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,760
is that all of the countries in this graph,

142
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,800
the wealth holding of governments

143
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,200
has decreased significantly over time.

144
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,560
So that one line at the top is China.

145
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
You won't be surprised, the Chinese government

146
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,760
is essentially a communist country.

147
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,200
The government owns a lot of the wealth in the country.

148
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,280
The other countries on the graph

149
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,160
are all Western countries.

150
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
So you've got the USA on there, UK in there,

151
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,880
Germany, Japan, I think France is on there.

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,480
And the story of the rest of these countries

153
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,960
is basically all the same. They’ve all the...

154
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,680
the wealth holding of the government

155
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,360
has decreasing significantly over time.

156
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,720
And I want you to notice that in the case of both

157
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,120
the UK and the US, that number went below

158
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,400
0% in the early 2010s.

159
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,040
So the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

160
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,120
So what that means is the total wealth

161
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
of the UK government,

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,560
the US government

163
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,680
and basically every other Western government

164
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,080
is in a pretty similar situation, is now below zero.

165
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,800
So that means these guys have debts

166
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,760
bigger than their assets.

167
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,520
Note that that graph ends in 2014.

168
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
The situation during COVID got significantly worse, so

169
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,440
now these graphs will drop down significantly

170
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,840
and what you will see is significant

171
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,000
negative wealth holding for the British government,

172
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,960
for the American government,

173
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,800
basically every Western government.

174
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
Now, I want you to remember the story

175
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,920
I told you about you and your house,

176
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,200
because Western governments,

177
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,880
including the British and American governments,

178
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,840
are basically in this situation.

179
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Back sort of 50 years ago,

180
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,640
Western governments had a lot of wealth.

181
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,240
They essentially own their own house.

182
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
Now, of course, when we talk about governments,

183
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,560
it's not just housing.

184
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,440
We're talking about governments

185
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,320
owning things like hospitals, like schools.

186
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
But of course, in the case of the UK,

187
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,200
the UK government did own also a significant amount

188
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,640
of housing back in the seventies.

189
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Governments have lost this wealth now.

190
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
So governments are in the same situation

191
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
basically as you would be if you lost your home.

192
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
So governments,

193
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,040
you know,

194
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,560
they provide, in the West

195
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,280
a lot of services, education, health care.

196
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,400
They used to provide housing

197
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,880
for the poorest people in the countries

198
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,960
and they were able to do this

199
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,440
because they owned the wealth, they owned hospitals,

200
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,120
they owned schools, they owned housing.

201
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
And what we learned from that Piketty graph

202
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,600
that I showed you

203
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
is that basically Western governments do not own

204
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
any wealth anymore.

205
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,480
And the fact that the number has dropped

206
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,320
below zero,

207
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
means that not only do they not own wealth,

208
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,160
they're actually in a significant amount of debt.

209
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,960
So what does that mean?

210
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,480
Governments still need to provide you with health care,

211
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,280
but they don't own the hospital.

212
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Governments still need to provide you with education,

213
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,200
but they don't own the school.

214
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,960
Governments still need to provide

215
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,760
the poorest people in society with housing,

216
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,720
but they don't own the homes.

217
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,560
Now, things like health care and education

218
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,280
are never very cheap to provide anyway.

219
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,320
You need

220
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,160
to pay for doctors, you need to pay for teachers.

221
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,240
But they're a lot cheaper to

222
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,640
provide when you own the buildings.

223
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
If you don't own the building,

224
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,520
then you need to pay rent on the building.

225
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,560
If you have a massive amount of debt,

226
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,120
then you need to pay interest on that debt.

227
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,880
So now governments are in situations,

228
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,520
just as you are in,

229
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
previously they didn't need to pay that rent,

230
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,880
they didn't need to pay that debt interest,

231
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
and now they've got to pay it.

232
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,760
What that means is

233
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,880
if they want to provide you

234
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,600
with the same level of service

235
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
that they used to provide you

236
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,080
with 30, 40, 50 years ago,

237
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
they simply need more tax money

238
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
because they no longer own the assets

239
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,880
and they need to pay rent or interest on those assets.

240
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,640
So I think this is a really important thing

241
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,520
for you to understand,

242
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,240
and it really completely explains the situation

243
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
that we are in.

244
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
The reason that governments

245
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,760
are having to charge much higher levels of tax

246
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,880
to provide

247
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,920
much worse levels of service is quite simply

248
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,240
because governments are much, much poorer now.

249
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
Governments are really poor.

250
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,840
And when governments are rich,

251
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,080
they have what you could call in

252
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,960
modern lingo passive income,

253
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
you know, they own the property,

254
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
they don't need to pay for the property

255
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120
and they can use those passive incomes

256
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,840
to provide you with government services.

257
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,160
Governments are no longer rich.

258
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,600
Governments are now very poor.

259
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,760
They need to rent everything they use,

260
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,240
they need to pay interest.

261
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
And that means they've taken that money from you.

262
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,040
And despite taking more money from you,

263
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,680
they can't provide services.

264
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,840
That is what happens when you go

265
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,920
from being rich to being poor.

266
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,720
Now, this wouldn't necessarily be a problem

267
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,920
if the assets which the government

268
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,680
has lost, the wealth which the government has lost,

269
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,200
were held by ordinary families.

270
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,520
So, you know, one thing I want you to realise

271
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,080
is this loss in government wealth,

272
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,640
you know, these assets, these hospitals, these schools,

273
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,360
they have not disappeared. They're all still here.

274
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,800
These assets must have gone to somebody.

275
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,000
And if those assets had gone to ordinary people,

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,320
it wouldn't necessarily be a problem.

277
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,880
I think the best example to illustrate

278
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,040
that is the council housing, right?

279
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,880
So when council housing was sold off in sort of

280
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,960
the ‘80s and the ’90s,

281
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
the people who benefited from that

282
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,040
initially were the people

283
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,160
who lived in the council houses. Council houses

284
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,520
were given to poorer people,

285
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,240
so it benefited the poor people.

286
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,400
Now the government didn't have the homes,

287
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,840
but the people who needed the housing

288
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,120
owned their own homes.

289
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,520
So it wasn't initially a problem

290
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,960
if it was just a transfer of wealth

291
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,240
from the government to the people,

292
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,800
then it wouldn't necessarily matter

293
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
because the people would be richer now.

294
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They could pay more taxes or the government wouldn't

295
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,680
need to provide so many services

296
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,840
because you directly would own things

297
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,920
like your own homes.

298
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,720
The problem that we have is that actually in the last,

299
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,680
you know, 30, 40 year period

300
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,920
in which you have seen

301
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
governments have massively lost their wealth.

302
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,400
We have also seen a significant loss of wealth

303
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,360
in ordinary families.

304
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,640
And I think this is

305
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,240
something I talk about a lot on the channel,

306
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,760
but it is most visible in two things.

307
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,960
Number one, the massively decreased

308
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,320
home ownership rates for young people.

309
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,920
You know, here in this country

310
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,600
and in the US, ordinary families,

311
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
their wealth tends to be in housing.

312
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,040
So if younger people are not getting housing,

313
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,760
it's a sign that families are losing their wealth.

314
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,600
And number two, the massively increased debt levels

315
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,440
for ordinary families,

316
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,600
especially families who manage to get a mortgage.

317
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,160
So I think this creates a kind of

318
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,120
interesting and confusing paradox, right.

319
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,040
Which is

320
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,400
how can it be possible

321
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,520
that government has lost its wealth

322
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,640
and ordinary families who lost their wealth?

323
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,120
Now the government gave, for example,

324
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,080
the council housing to ordinary families.

325
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,200
Now you have a situation where

326
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,880
both ordinary families and governments

327
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,760
are struggling to get housing.

328
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,840
And I think this reveals

329
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,040
the core of the problem,

330
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,240
which is something I talk about a lot on this channel,

331
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
which is that wealth,

332
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,000
which transferred initially from the government

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
to ordinary families,

334
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,000
has over time ended up being held by the very rich.

335
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,360
And you know, this happens to...

336
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,920
If you want to understand the mechanism of this,

337
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,040
you should watch the video we put a couple of weeks

338
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,480
ago called How You Lose Your House,

339
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,640
which is ordinary people

340
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,240
got this wealth from the government.

341
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,160
They use that wealth to support their lives,

342
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,080
to support their retirements,

343
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,560
to pay for end of life care.

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,480
And they ended up selling that wealth to the rich.

345
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,560
The end situation is

346
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,040
we end up in a place where both the government

347
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,280
and ordinary families have very little wealth.

348
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,960
Now, this is.

349
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,640
it’s kind of a disastrous situation, right.

350
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,800
Because we've already learned

351
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,040
the government is struggling to provide basic services

352
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,480
now because government is poor.

353
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,560
What does it mean

354
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,440
if on top of that, ordinary families are poor?

355
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Well, that means ordinary families

356
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,640
can't afford housing,

357
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,960
which means they really need housing.

358
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,120
But the government who used to have housing

359
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,960
doesn't have housing either,

360
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,920
so they can't provide you with housing.

361
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
It also means that

362
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,680
people are living lives of greater poverty.

363
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
They will live in worse conditions,

364
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,320
they will even worse housing.

365
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
They will eat worse diets, they will have more stress.

366
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,000
They will probably face more crime,

367
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,680
which means they'll need more health care.

368
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,840
But the government can't provide more health care

369
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:43,920
because the government has no assets. So I think this

370
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,160
really realises, makes real the problem

371
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,360
that I talk about on this channel.

372
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,120
So people who’ve watched for a long time will know

373
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm very, very worried

374
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,560
about growing inequality of wealth.

375
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,040
And I think

376
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,920
people have become

377
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,920
used to the idea that inequality is a social problem.

378
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,480
They’re used to, kind

379
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
of, people on the left

380
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,920
arguing that we need less inequality

381
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,440
because it's unfair. It's not good for society.

382
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,080
My worry is deeper than that.

383
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,640
My worry

384
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,120
is that when you have very high levels of inequality,

385
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,800
what it means is

386
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,280
you can't get

387
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,400
basic essential needs like housing and health care

388
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,520
and education.

389
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,720
You know,

390
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,640
in our economy we have a distribution of resources.

391
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,360
If both governments

392
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
and ordinary families are losing their wealth,

393
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,520
that wealth is going to the super rich.

394
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,440
And we've seen a ton of statistics

395
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,280
which show us that the super rich have enormously

396
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,400
increased their wealth in the last three years,

397
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,240
we had the biggest ever one year rise of wealth

398
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,400
by superrich in the first year of COVID.

399
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,680
If we give all of the resources to the rich,

400
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
if we bankrupt both ordinary families

401
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,320
and the government,

402
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
the consequence is

403
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
your family can't get a house,

404
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
your family can't get health care,

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,520
your family can't get

406
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,240
education, and the government

407
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
won't be able to provide them

408
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,520
because they are also poor.

409
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,120
So I think once you recognise that that is the problem,

410
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
that governments have lost their wealth

411
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,400
and therefore they can't provide services,

412
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,560
the only option that they appear to feel

413
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,360
they have is to tax the middle class

414
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,120
who are also losing their assets.

415
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,960
You realise that

416
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,360
the fundamental question here

417
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,840
and the only real way to solve this problem

418
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,440
is to get the assets back, basically.

419
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,560
And that doesn't necessarily mean

420
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,880
increasing the size of government.

421
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,280
It could mean transferring assets back

422
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,480
from the very rich

423
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,480
to the middle class, to the working classes.

424
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,560
And the fundamental question is

425
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
how do you get those assets back?

426
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,520
And I think if you want to address that question,

427
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,000
how do you get the assets back?

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,920
It is very helpful to consider yourself

429
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,560
from the position of a wealthy person.

430
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,440
So consider you all like,

431
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,160
a rich person, but not a super rich person.

432
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,760
So say you've got a net worth of £5 million,

433
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,840
which is of course a lot, but

434
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,000
the very rich have much, much more than that.

435
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,160
If you have a net worth of £5

436
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,720
million, lets assume you’re able

437
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,320
to make 5% a year on that £5 million,

438
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,200
you might make a bit less.

439
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,320
5% of £5 million is £250,000 a year.

440
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,040
Lets assume you make a bit less. £200,000 a year.

441
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,240
This is passive income, you

442
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,320
get this on top of your work,

443
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,560
you don't do any work to get it.

444
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,760
You're making £200,000 a year.

445
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,920
How much money would you spend?

446
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,080
Imagine you suddenly had a passive income of £200,000

447
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,480
a year.

448
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,080
You know, the ordinary person

449
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,120
probably spends £20,000 to £30,000 a year.

450
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,560
I suspect you probably raised your spending

451
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,720
to £60,000 a year, maybe £70,000 a year,

452
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,400
which would massively improve your lifestyle.

453
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,960
And you still have another £130,000

454
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,640
a year passive income,

455
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,880
which you could use to buy more assets.

456
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,760
Now, in a strong economy

457
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,080
that is growing rapidly,

458
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,400
you might be able to use this money

459
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,080
to create more assets.

460
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,560
But we don't live in a strong economy

461
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,800
that's growing rapidly, we haven't for some time.

462
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,000
You're probably going to use this money to buy

463
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,960
existing assets,

464
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,800
probably from the middle class,

465
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
probably from the government.

466
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,240
But the big problem you have here,

467
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,760
you will never sell your assets, will you?

468
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,880
If you have £5 million in assets,

469
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,480
you've got £160,000

470
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,160
a year passive income,

471
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,280
which you use to grow your assets.

472
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,760
You will never, ever sell your assets.

473
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,960
So if we exist in an economy

474
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,320
which is not really growing,

475
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
the rich will never sell their assets.

476
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,840
Not only that, they will continue to buy more assets.

477
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,640
You can see that it is already

478
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,880
and will become increasingly impossible

479
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,240
for the government or for you as an ordinary family

480
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,840
to ever get any of your assets back.

481
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,720
So, you know, this is the situation we are in.

482
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,960
Government is taxing you a lot

483
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,720
to pay for sh*tty services

484
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,280
because government's bankrupt

485
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,760
and you can't afford to pay those taxes

486
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,840
because ordinary families are bankrupt

487
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,760
and all of that wealth is gone

488
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,200
to the rich who are going to use it

489
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,160
to buy the rest of the wealth,

490
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,000
making you even more bankrupt.

491
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,400
And this essentially is the reason why

492
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,520
what I always campaign

493
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,080
for is significantly higher taxes on the very rich,

494
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,880
because I don't see any other way of you

495
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,440
getting your assets back.

496
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,560
And I want to talk a little bit

497
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,760
about how this could work,

498
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,080
how we could make this society better.

499
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240
I think the only way

500
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
you get wealth flowing in the other direction,

501
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,480
you tax very rich people much, much more.

502
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,240
You use that money

503
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,040
to significantly reduce taxes on working people.

504
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Your taxes are less.

505
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,080
So you start to be able to accumulate a bit of money.

506
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,120
Rich people's taxes are much, much more

507
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,960
so they need to sell their assets

508
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,400
in order to pay for the taxes.

509
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,920
You've got more money.

510
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,680
The rich need to sell assets.

511
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,200
You ordinary working families

512
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,400
can start to buy those assets back from the rich.

513
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,920
So the reason I support higher taxation on the rich

514
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,800
is because, number one,

515
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,080
it's the only way to reduce your taxes.

516
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,640
And number two,

517
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,360
it's the only way for you, ordinary families,

518
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
to get your assets back.

519
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,560
The point I want to make here is, you know,

520
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,920
when I talk about taxes,

521
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,920
we're in an interesting place here in society where,

522
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
you know, understandably,

523
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,200
the middle class is getting quite heavily taxed,

524
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
largely because the rich pay very low taxes.

525
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,880
And if you haven't watched,

526
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,800
I would encourage you to watch our video

527
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,720
Who Pays Tax?

528
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,800
Because the very rich often pay

529
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,680
very, very low rates of tax.

530
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,720
And that has led to a situation where ordinary people

531
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
and particularly slightly

532
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,680
higher earning people, middle class

533
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,800
people are very opposed to tax.

534
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,360
And yet tax is essentially

535
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,480
the only way that they will ever get richer.

536
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,320
So ordinary people have been

537
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,240
put in a situation

538
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,680
where for very understandable reasons,

539
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,920
they oppose the only possible policy measure

540
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,160
which could save them from poverty.

541
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,200
And I think,

542
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,840
you know, this is supported by ideas

543
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,000
like tax is wasted, like tax is corrupt,

544
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,440
like tax goes to a corrupt government.

545
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Taxing the rich can be used to lower your taxes

546
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,240
and that is the only way that you can get your assets

547
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,440
back from wealthy people.

548
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
If we don't tax them,

549
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,920
they will continue to never sell any assets

550
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,880
have enormous amounts of passive income

551
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,480
which they and their kids will use to outcompete

552
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,960
you and your kids for the assets

553
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,280
which you currently own

554
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,840
and in the end your family will own nothing.

555
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,560
So listen, tax for me is...

556
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,160
it's not about increasing the size of government.

557
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,640
It's not about more levels of government spending.

558
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
Tax for me is about defending ordinary families

559
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
from the growing power and wealth of the rich.

560
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,040
It's about getting wealth

561
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,720
back into the hands of ordinary people,

562
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,080
and it's about making life better,

563
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,040
or at the very least stopping life from getting worse.

564
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,760
So to conclude,

565
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,520
I would like to make the clear point that the only way

566
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,360
to reduce the tax burden

567
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,440
for you, for ordinary families like you,

568
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,120
is to increase taxes.

569
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,480
But to increase taxes on the rich.

570
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,120
We're going to campaign for it. We're here every week.

571
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,000
Tell your friends. Tell your mum. Thank you.
