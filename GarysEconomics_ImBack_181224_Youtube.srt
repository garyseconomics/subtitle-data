1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,080
Okay.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm back.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,720
Okay, so I've been gone about four months.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,720
Thanks for waiting.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,440
Lots has happened.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,640
Today we're going to talk about where I've been,

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,120
what I've been doing.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
The things that I've missed.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,920
Mainly the two big elections

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
and what we're going to do for the channel this year.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
So we kept the videos going out on this channel

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,040
until about the end of August,

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,680
but I actually went away, just before the end of June,

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,760
which was just before the election here in the UK.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,640
And I went away

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,560
just before the election on

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,680
purpose, to be honest, because,

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,040
it was very obvious before the election

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,280
that Labour would win.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
And Labour would win by quite a significant margin.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
And some people who watch this

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
channel and see me supporting

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,160
wealth taxes and

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,880
increased tax on the rich and trying to reduce

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,920
inequality, might have assumed that I was

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,360
some big Labour supporter,

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,920
but in reality, I think it was clear

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,080
and has been clear for quite a while,

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,640
that it's very unlikely

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,360
Labour are going to do anything significant

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,840
on inequality or wealth tax or tax on the super rich.

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,560
And for that reason,

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,520
the election was a little bit depressing for me,

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,840
and I was getting quite down, to be honest

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,320
coming into the election.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,960
Because I'd been expecting the election

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,240
to be

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,520
in sort of November, it came in June,

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,400
and I felt at the time like we're not

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,280
big enough to put any pressure on the government,

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,000
or the incoming government.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,920
They're not going to offer us anything.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,800
They're not going to give us anything.

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,760
And it was just quite depressing to see

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,000
after sort of

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,760
working really hard on this channel for a long time,

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,080
that it's going to be another

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,240
five years, another government

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
that are probably not going to give us anything.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,960
And I think in a sense

51
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,720
it was easier emotionally in a way,

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,680
when we had these kind of

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,360
comedy villains in charge of the country.

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
You know,

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,440
Rishi Sunak, son-in-law

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,160
of one of the richest men in the world,

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,200
Boris Johnson,

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,640
David Cameron, Liz Truss,

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,720
George Osborne,

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,200
these guys that look like bad guys in a Disney film.

61
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Because when you have these kind of...

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,920
kind of obvious villains in charge, it's very easy

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,320
to point the finger at these guys and say,

64
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,640
these guys are the bad guys.

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,120
Let's give these guys a good kicking.

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,240
Let's kick him out and then let's changed things.

67
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,200
But the truth is, and it is obvious now

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,320
that the problem is and always was deeper than that.

69
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,280
And it is made obvious

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,960
by the fact that the Labour government have come in.

71
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,080
And if you saw my video on the election before

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,200
I went away,

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
I said very clearly in that video,

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
we will get a new Labour government,

75
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
they will get a big mandate,

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
they'll get a big majority despite being unpopular.

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,040
And they will fail on inequality,

78
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,360
which means they will fail on the economy

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,480
and they will be very unpopular very quickly. And that

80
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,840
at this point is kind of obviously true.

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,080
What it makes clear is that the problem

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,480
is bigger than left or right.

83
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
The problem is bigger than Labour or Conservative.

84
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,160
We have a problem

85
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,240
in this country, but it is not only in this country.

86
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
And I think the situation in America

87
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,880
and in many other countries proves

88
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,400
this problem goes way, way beyond just the UK.

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,520
There is a problem of a broad consensus of economists,

90
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,440
but also of these kind of semi idiotic

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,760
upper middle class, elite university

92
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,280
academics and intellectuals and elites

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,720
that are simply very, very unwilling to

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,320
even talk about inequality as part of the problem.

95
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,480
And they want to talk about things like

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,280
economic growth and efficiency

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,760
and increasing GDP and,

98
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,960
pulling our socks up and all working a bit harder.

99
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,840
All the while, wealth absolutely floods

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,560
to the rich and the super rich,

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,680
and nobody seems to fix that problem.

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,520
So yeah, it was a bit depressing going away.

103
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,320
Well, it's a bit depressing seeing the election come in

104
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,280
and just knowing

105
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,880
the problem is way bigger than one election.

106
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,280
The problem is way bigger than just winning.

107
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,920
We're just kicking a party out of government.

108
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,120
It's very easy to kick a party out of government,

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,520
but it's much harder to fix a problem.

110
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,360
So

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,680
I went away to sort of sit down and have a think about

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
what can we do, what can we do to... to fight this?

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,400
Because the truth is, we are going to have five years

114
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,080
of Labour government now, and I hope I'm wrong on this.

115
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
And I want to make it clear

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,880
before I say what I was about to say.

117
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,760
I don't think that

118
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,200
the Labour government is full of corrupt villains.

119
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,240
There's probably one or two in there.

120
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,320
Some of these guys want to do the best thing

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,080
for their country.

122
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,400
And, despite that, the fact is

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,840
I really don’t

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
think we're going to get anything from them.

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,000
So what do we do? What can we do?

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,360
What do you do when you live in a two party

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,600
political system,

128
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,720
and both parties

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,360
are absolutely incapable of recognising

130
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
an enormous

131
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,440
gaping hole

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,560
in the bottom of the economy

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
that just grows and grows day after day.

134
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,560
And that's what I went away to think about basically,

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
what can we do?

136
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
What can I do?

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,400
What can you do?

138
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,880
And also, to be honest, just to like

139
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,840
get a bit of a rest. It's been a bad year.

140
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,640
Like the growth of the channel has been insane.

141
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,240
I get recognised like 6 or 7 times a day.

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,480
I get like tons of emails from loads of people.

143
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,000
People who want to help, people

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,640
who want to like, work for us.

145
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,680
People who want to do stuff.

146
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
And,

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
I get so many messages that it's impossible

148
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,200
for me to basically read all the messages and,

149
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,080
you know, people stop me in the street

150
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,160
and they say, you know,

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,320
we're counting on you to do something.

152
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,760
You know, we believe you can do something.

153
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,680
And it's hard when people say that

154
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,560
when you know, my like,

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
honest assessment of the situation is

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,440
it's just going to get worse.

157
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
So I needed to take a bit of time away,

158
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,120
basically to figure out like, well, what can we do?

159
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,200
Can we do anything? Just clear my head basically.

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,560
But now we're back.

161
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,080
We're going to be back with weekly videos,

162
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,360
and we are going to try,

163
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,880
whether we succeed or not I don't know,

164
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
we're going to try to get into a situation

165
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,080
where we could change things.

166
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,120
And the channel is growing a lot,

167
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
which genuinely gives us

168
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,720
a little bit of political power. But it's not enough.

169
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,280
The truth is, if we want to really impact change here,

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
we need to be bigger.

171
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,680
And this is the kind of thing

172
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,640
which I've been rolling around in my head,

173
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,920
because the truth is,

174
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,440
like even

175
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,080
the level of kind of

176
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,120
fame and scrutiny and attention that I get

177
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,560
now sometimes makes me uncomfortable.

178
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,040
But if we want to have a political impact

179
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,880
and we want to stop this from getting worse and worse,

180
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,800
we need to be much bigger.

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,520
We need to be much bigger,

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,640
the channels needs to be much bigger.

183
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,000
So I honestly think

184
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,400
there is a massive

185
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,520
gap in our media for just communicating economics

186
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,040
in an ordinary,

187
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,760
simple, plain speaking, understandable way

188
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,600
to ordinary people.

189
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,000
I think that 80, 90% of people in this country

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,360
don't have any economic communicator

191
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,680
that is communicating to them on the news

192
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,480
what's happening in a way they understand.

193
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
Never mind the way

194
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,080
that is like welcoming and accessible.

195
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,240
And I think in a world where the economy

196
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,640
has gotten massively worse

197
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,280
and will continue

198
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
to get worse, and living standards

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,760
will continue to get worse for ordinary people,

200
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,560
and there is continuing financial insecurity.

201
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,640
People want that.

202
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,640
People want somebody who can explain what's happening

203
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,960
in a way that is clear

204
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
and in a way that makes sense to them.

205
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,320
And I think that is the reason

206
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,160
why the channel has grown so much with,

207
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,480
you know, with very few people working on it.

208
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,360
We've never had

209
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,760
even a single member of full time

210
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,240
staff on this channel,

211
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,760
full time paid staff is including me.

212
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,480
With no full time

213
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,040
paid staff with very, very little funding,

214
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,120
we've managed to build this channel

215
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
up to more than half a million subs now, and it's grown

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,200
something like six or seven

217
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,120
or eight times in the last year,

218
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
and it's not going to go eight times every year.

219
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,880
But if we can keep growing at anything like that speed,

220
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,760
then maybe we can

221
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,840
get a little bit of political influence.

222
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,120
Labour are already very unpopular.

223
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
There's a degree to which they won't care

224
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,520
about that at the moment,

225
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,280
because there's not going to be

226
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,400
another election for four and a half years.

227
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Two, three years down the line

228
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,120
when they're still very unpopular

229
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,080
and when it starts to become clear

230
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,600
that you cannot improve the economy

231
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,840
without, well,

232
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,440
when it starts to become clear to them that

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,240
what they're doing is not working,

234
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,320
politically they will have to have a rebrand.

235
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,560
They will have to have a rebrand.

236
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,880
They will have to have a new offer.

237
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,560
I have to try to get this channel to a position where

238
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,400
the obvious common sense amongst the public is,

239
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,720
you need to deal with inequality,

240
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,160
and you need to do what Gary's Economics

241
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,880
says, you know,

242
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,120
and I know maybe that sounds egotistical, but

243
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,560
what else can I do here,

244
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,360
the thing is going to collapse.

245
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,400
It's going to get worse.

246
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
There's going to be really broad poverty.

247
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,280
Labour are not going to stop it.

248
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,640
We need to raise the voice.

249
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,960
We need to raise the voice.

250
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
So I have to think about

251
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,400
what can we do to grow the channel.

252
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,360
And, this year, we are

253
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,160
going to get another big publicity campaign

254
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,080
from Penguin.

255
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,800
The paperback of the book is coming out,

256
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,000
and I've just received it in the mail by courier.

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
So I will open and show it to you,

258
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,920
then new cover at the end of the video.

259
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,240
You know, we have to try to grasp that and to grow it.

260
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,600
We're going to be doing another

261
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,440
a public tour around the country.

262
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,240
So hopefully some of you will get a chance to meet me

263
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,120
and ask me whatever questions you have.

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
We have to try and take that and run with it.

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
But what that means is

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
we have to professionalise the channel.

267
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,520
Basically. I don't think we we have a choice.

268
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,200
If we are going to be politically powerful.

269
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,080
We need staff and I need staff.

270
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,240
I just don't think there's any way

271
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,960
that I can cope with making it

272
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
significantly bigger than it is

273
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,320
without any full time staff, Basically.

274
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
And that means we are going to need funding,

275
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
and that means that we are going to open a Patreon.

276
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,880
I spoke about it just before I went away.

277
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,040
We're going to open a Patreon

278
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,600
and we're going to see what we what we get.

279
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,440
And, you know, I don't know, it will get a lot.

280
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,760
I don't know whether we'll get a little,

281
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
but if we want to be politically powerful down

282
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
the line, we're going to need staff.

283
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
And if we need staff...

284
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,840
we need staff, we're going to need funding.

285
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,920
Just help support me

286
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,280
and help us to get a little bit more ambitious

287
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,000
and diverse with the creativity of what we do.

288
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Help us to work with different creatives,

289
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,400
help us to get different people on the channel.

290
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
So it's not just like me

291
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,400
every week in my No Face hoodie,

292
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,440
but that's what I'm going to do.

293
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,880
We're going to open a Patreon.

294
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,760
We're going to put a list of like

295
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,480
prices in there.

296
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,800
So I think, I think we're going to do £5 a month

297
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,640
or £20 a month.

298
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
I want to make clear right now,

299
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
we are never going to pay wall these videos.

300
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,920
The Patreon doesn't mean, like,

301
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,040
you need to pay towards the channel.

302
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,440
We're never going to do that.

303
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
I think I'll write a newsletter and I'll do, like,

304
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,800
a, like a video Q&A

305
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,760
once a month for people on the Patreon.

306
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,720
But that Patreon is going to be there

307
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,480
so that we can fund staff, fund these videos.

308
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,440
And these videos will always be free

309
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,360
and open to the public.

310
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,320
But we just have to do it like it's... it's

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,480
difficult for me to run this thing

312
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,960
without any full time staff.

313
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,880
And I'm very grateful for the guys who do help me.

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,960
And we got a part time manager.

315
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,040
We've got Jack here doing the camera,

316
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,160
but we're going to need, we're gonna need more

317
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,280
if we're going to be serious.

318
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,960
And I don't know if it'll work.

319
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,080
You know,

320
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,680
maybe we won't get enough money for staff,

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,720
and maybe we won't be able to expand it. And then...

322
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,680
And then probably we'll never be able to have

323
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
a massive political impact.

324
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,280
But either way, I'll keep making the videos.

325
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,600
But it's kind of

326
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,720
I need to see whether we have a shot

327
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,520
to have an impact here.

328
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,040
I think I have a responsibility to myself

329
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,720
and to the country to see, to see if I can.

330
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm not saying I'm going to change it by myself,

331
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,800
but if we get a bit of funding

332
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,400
can maybe make a proper like professional

333
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,560
organisation here that can just help me,

334
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,600
help me grow it, help me make more cool videos

335
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,960
and help me feel more supported and have a good run.

336
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,400
So what what we're going to do.

337
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,640
So I've been thinking about this while I was away.

338
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,400
Some of you might want to know about my time in Japan.

339
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,960
My time in Japan was amazing.

340
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,760
It was really, really hot.

341
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,160
I cycled from Tokyo to Hiroshima.

342
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,600
But I've been back a few months, actually.

343
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,640
I got back, around about the end of August.

344
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,440
I've been working on basically setting up a company

345
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,600
because, I want the Patreon....

346
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,920
I don't want the Patreon money to come to me.

347
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,160
I want it to go into a company

348
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,680
that we can release the accounts,

349
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,440
and you can see that

350
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
none of the Patreon money goes to me.

351
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,280
All of the Patreon money will always be used to cover

352
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,200
the cost of the channel.

353
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,320
The plan at the moment is

354
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,720
I won't start using the Patreon money

355
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,840
immediately as it comes in.

356
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,480
We'll start to like pool it a little bit there

357
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
so we can see basically how much we're getting,

358
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
and then we can figure out, like, what can we do?

359
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,480
Can we get a full time

360
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,560
staff member, can we get a couple?

361
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,640
And basically try and figure out

362
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,520
like how much income we have

363
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,240
and what we can do with it?

364
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,080
But don't expect to see any massive changes

365
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,720
like imminently.

366
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
It's just a question of...

367
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,840
Really, it's a question of just professionalising it.

368
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,480
You know, I look at sort of,

369
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
what we have achieved this year with the growth.

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
A big part of the reason we've grown so much

371
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,520
this year is because we've had a professional publicist

372
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,240
from Penguin working to publicise the channel.

373
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,280
She's been amazing.

374
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
I won't mention her name

375
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,280
because I don't know if she wants me to mention her,

376
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
but she's been great.

377
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,280
And, you know, the whole team at Penguin

378
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,800
have been great, but

379
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
the massive growth from last year,

380
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
because we've had a publicist

381
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,080
and the publicist

382
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,640
ultimately doesn't work for the YouTube

383
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,520
or the political project.

384
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,760
She works for the book and,

385
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,680
you know, the book is amazing.

386
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,920
I encorage you to buy the book.

387
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,960
The paperback is coming out

388
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,600
Jan, so the paperback will be...

389
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,840
if you were waiting for the book to be a bit cheaper,

390
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,200
that's going to come out in Jan 30th

391
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,160
and I think that's going to be something

392
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,120
like £11 or £12 maybe,

393
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
but much cheaper than the hardback.

394
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
That will come out, we'll get a big publicity campaign,

395
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,040
but at some point,

396
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,840
you know, Penguin are going to stop publicising us

397
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,760
and we need to have somebody who works for the channel

398
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,720
to help us publicise it.

399
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,160
We need someone who helps us to YouTube optimise,

400
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
and we need someone who just helps us make banging

401
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,720
videos week after week, basically.

402
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,280
But yes,

403
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,200
the thing I wanted to make clear

404
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,440
is we're going to set up a company

405
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,720
and all of the Patreon money will go to the company.

406
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,880
None of it will come to me.

407
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
It's not going to be used to pay me.

408
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm not going to take a salary.

409
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,320
The Patreon money will always be ringfenced

410
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,720
for supporting production of content and

411
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,440
if we get enough,

412
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,560
ultimately trying to push a bit of a political project,

413
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,520
trying to grow it as a political project,

414
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,320
trying to put pressure on politicians in the long run,

415
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,800
but basically trying to...

416
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,960
trying to achieve something

417
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,880
rather than just making videos.

418
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
But we will keep making videos and good videos,

419
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,400
and I would also, if we get enough, like to be able to

420
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,160
support some other creatives to help make good stuff.

421
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,720
Like I've been making a video

422
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,960
with a friend of mine called Stefan.

423
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,160
I think that's really good

424
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,640
and we're going to put that on the channel.

425
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,000
He's a filmmaker,

426
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,160
but yeah,

427
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,520
make better content,

428
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,760
make more frequent content,

429
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,840
be more effective, grow quicker.

430
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,920
But also importantly, to help me feel more supported

431
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,640
because I do find it difficult making these videos.

432
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,720
I do find the kind of a level of fame I get difficult.

433
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,400
But, look,

434
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,280
you know, I've put this off for a long time

435
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,920
because, I know there's going to be like

436
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,880
some people that kickback...

437
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,080
Oh this guy’s trying to make money.

438
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,920
I'm not going to take money from the Patreon.

439
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,080
You know, we've never put adverts in these videos

440
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,440
because I'm not in this to make money.

441
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
I’m in this to try and educate people

442
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
about what's happening. If you don't do anything,

443
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,080
this gets worse.

444
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,720
But we can do something.

445
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,960
I think if we

446
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,800
provide the space where the public can come

447
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,920
and be educated

448
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,680
in a way that is clear about what is happening,

449
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,080
people can understand the reason

450
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,160
for their worsening living

451
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,200
conditions; is growing inequality.

452
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,720
And if people understand that,

453
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
they will feel empowered to fight against it.

454
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,760
There's tons of more things I can say about that,

455
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,000
and we will say them, but this video is getting long.

456
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,520
But listen,

457
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,280
nobody has to subscribe to Patreon.

458
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,560
Like, these videos will be here

459
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
like they've always been,

460
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,040
and they'll be free like they've always been.

461
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,480
Watch the videos, understand

462
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
the videos, share them, and support them.

463
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,480
Share them with you friends,

464
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,080
share them with your family.

465
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,960
I'm not putting no pressure on nobody.

466
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,800
If we want to grow this, we are going to need staff.

467
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,240
And if we're going to need staff, we need funding.

468
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,360
The funding is not going to go to me.

469
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
It's going to go to staff.

470
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,640
But, I'm back. I'll keep making weekly videos,

471
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
for as long as I can.

472
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,200
Last year I took a break of six months,

473
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,920
and when I came back,

474
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,280
the views were like higher than before I went away.

475
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,360
And,

476
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,840
I was quite emotional about that, to be honest,

477
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,040
because I find it difficult

478
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,840
making weekly videos like, I'm not really like,

479
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,400
you know, my background is maths and economics.

480
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,480
I'm not like a creative

481
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,400
and it stresses me out

482
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,880
trying to do like new videos every week.

483
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,000
And I don't like talking to camera.

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,320
But the fact that people are still there

485
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,760
after six months really

486
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,520
made me feel like

487
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,320
I was being supported

488
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,520
to take the time out of that need,

489
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,240
and it made me feel

490
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,480
that I can stick around in the long term.

491
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
People who read my book will know

492
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,800
that I've had difficulties

493
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,720
in the past in my mental health,

494
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,320
and I don't like being attacked in the newspapers.

495
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,440
But this is important, and it's worth it.

496
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,440
So...

497
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,520
I'll keep doing it.

498
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,640
Thank you for your support. Happy new year.

499
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,120
Oh, yeah.

500
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,760
Oh, my days!

501
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,920
So I've got the new paperback,

502
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,520
and you guys are going to love the cover.

503
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,640
Good that Jack reminded me otherwise Penguin would have

504
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,240
chopped my balls off.

505
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,800
So we’ll do an unboxing here.

506
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,080
We're going to keep this

507
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,720
and put it on my first ASMR video.

508
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,040
So this is the paperback.

509
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I think it's £11 or £12.

510
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,960
I probably should have asked. Anyway, there you go.

511
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,080
You got that focus on that alright?

512
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,440
So they put my face on the cover,

513
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,960
which, as you can see, it's beautiful.

514
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,280
And I'm delighted about.

515
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,440
I was...

516
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,960
I was a little bit, concerned about this

517
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,320
because obviously this will be in the window of,

518
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,120
like, every bookshop in the country.

519
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,360
With my face on the cover.

520
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,080
But, at the end of the day.

521
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
That's going to help us grow

522
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,560
the channel,

523
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
and it's going to help us grow the political project.

524
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,000
And I think it's important.

525
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,080
And I'm really proud of this book

526
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,280
and this book has helped us grow massively this year.

527
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,320
Well, yeah. Last year, yeah, I would recommend it.

528
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,400
It's probably the thing

529
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,440
that I'm most proud of, of things

530
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,320
I've done in my life, really.

531
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,080
But, yeah, this is the book.

532
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,200
Thanks to Penguin. Thanks for all your support. And,

533
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,440
yeah, look, we're not going to grow

534
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,240
eight times every year,

535
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
but if we can keep growing anything

536
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
like what we've been growing,

537
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,160
then they'll have to listen to us sooner or later.

538
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,320
So, yeah. Thanks for your help. Good luck.
