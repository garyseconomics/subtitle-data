1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Okay.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,200
Welcome back to Garys Economics.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,360
Today, we're going to predict the next election, and

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,560
we are going to answer the question, will Reform win?

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:09,920
Okay.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,480
So whenever I want to make a prediction about politics,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,840
the first thing I always do is I check the odds.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,040
The betting odds are not always right, but I think it's

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,360
always a good idea to look at what the market thinks

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,280
and then compare it to what you think, and see

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,040
if you can understand what the difference might be.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,600
So I look at these odds a lot.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,160
Obviously, I used to be a trader.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm looking at the markets a lot.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,280
But I also do, now I'm interested in politics,

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,720
look at the betting markets for politics a lot.

17
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,440
So we're going to flash these up here.

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,880
I go to Betfair, and I look at the market.

19
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,320
It's a little bit difficult to

20
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,800
translate, so I'll do it for you.

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,600
This here shows the betting market for who will

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,960
get the most seats at the next UK election.

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,400
These two red and blue numbers,

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,000
they show, a range of probabilities.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
And if you divide one by the

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,240
number, you get the probability.

27
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,800
I'll do the maths for you.

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,800
What this says is that Reform have almost exactly 50%

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,480
chance of getting the most seats at the next election,

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,360
and Labour have... That's probably going to be something

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,040
like about 32% chance of getting the most seats.

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,680
And then you've got the Conservatives

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,840
down at... That's going to be about 12%.

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
And then there's about a 2% chance for the Lib

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,720
Dems and a little bit for a few other parties.

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,960
So basically, the betting market thinks

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,240
that Reform have almost exactly 50% chance of

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,200
getting the most seats at the next election.

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,760
And that probability has been steadily climbing,

40
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,040
really, over the past few months I've been following it.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,760
Does that mean Reform will win the next election?

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,840
Now, this is a little bit more

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,240
complicated because in the UK we now have a

44
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,080
multi-party system, which is kind of amazing.

45
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,560
We've never really had one before.

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,400
Because the main two historic parties, Labour

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,960
and Conservatives, are very unpopular now, we're

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,680
going to get a situation in the next election

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,720
where really a lot of parties get a lot of seats.

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,200
Most seats will go to Reform and Labour, but

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,240
the Conservatives will probably still get a few.

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
The Liberal Democrats will get

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,280
a big chunk like they did last election.

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,840
And I think the Greens will also get

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
a decent chunk for the first time ever.

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
And I think because Labour will be unpopular,

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
the SNP, the Scottish National Party in

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,680
Scotland, will get a lot of seats as well.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Now, the betting market thinks... We can

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,640
also ask the betting market whether it

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,320
thinks anyone will get an overall majority.

62
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,800
So the way it works in this country

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,080
is they'll get a number of seats.

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,440
Historically, the winning party almost always gets

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,920
a majority, which means more than 50% of the seats.

66
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,720
But because in the next election the vote

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,160
will be so divided, there's a good chance that

68
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,120
whoever wins, be it Reform or Labour, who it will

69
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,960
almost certainly be one of those two parties,

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,800
neither one will get an overall majority.

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,680
So we can also look at the betting market here for

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,520
overall majority, and what you see is that the chance

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,840
of there being a majority is... They reckon there's

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,960
about a 52% chance that we'll have what we call a

75
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,520
hung parliament, which means no one has a majority.

76
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,400
So there's a good chance, according to the

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
betting market, Reform will get the most seats,

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,360
but they will not get enough seats to get a majority.

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,120
Which then means there's the possibility

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,240
for, like, coalitions, and you could end up

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,560
with this really complicated situation where

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,320
Reform have more seats, but you would imagine, because

83
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,480
Reform are quite unpopular other than with Reform

84
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,440
voters, that the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, and

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,120
the Scottish National Party might support Labour.

86
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,400
Which might give them more seats than Reform, but

87
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,320
then the Conservatives, will they support Reform?

88
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
Maybe they will, maybe they won't.

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,640
So you could end up in this really complicated, like,

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
split situation where Reform have the most seats, but as

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,600
a coalition, Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the Greens,

92
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,560
have more, and then what will the Conservatives do?

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
And it could be phenomenally complicated, really.

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
So basically, when we look at the betting

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,080
market, what the betting market tells us is

96
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,080
it's 50/50 Reform will get the most seats, but we

97
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,600
don't know whether that will be enough for them to

98
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,160
get a majority or to form a government.

99
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Okay.

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,800
But that is the betting market.

101
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
And obviously, as you know, because I talk about

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,840
it a lot, I was a former trader, and I was a

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,480
very successful trader, and I still do trade now.

104
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,200
When I look at the odds for anything, financial

105
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,760
market, betting market, I'm always asking myself,

106
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,440
"What do I know that the betting market doesn't know?

107
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,840
Could the betting market be wrong?" And I've got

108
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,160
a pretty good track record recently of correctly

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,480
predicting politics based really on just one

110
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,160
thing which I know, which political

111
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
forecasters generally don't know, which is

112
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
that the economy and the economic situation and

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,440
living standards are going to keep getting worse.

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
This is based on the very simple understanding,

115
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
which I speak about a lot on this channel,

116
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
which is that falling living standards are

117
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,880
linked to rapidly growing wealth inequality.

118
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,600
Our political leaders are not doing

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,840
anything about growing wealth inequality, which

120
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,160
means that inequality will continue to grow

121
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,520
and living standards will continue to fall.

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,960
Understanding that is basically why I was able to

123
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,120
predict the failure of Rishi Sunak, the failure

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,240
of Keir Starmer, and the rising popularity of Reform.

125
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,160
That will keep happening.

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,840
Living standards will keep falling, which means that

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,960
by the time we get to the next election, and the

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,200
next election here in this country is not due until

129
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,000
2029... By the time we get to the next election,

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
living standards will be even worse than they are now.

131
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,560
The economic situation will be worse, and this will

132
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,080
be basically devastating for the popularity of Labour.

133
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,560
And this is why I think you've seen

134
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,120
Reform's odds rising and rising and rising.

135
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,880
That is basically because the longer Labour are in

136
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,160
power, whilst they do nothing about inequality, it is

137
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
basically inevitable that living standards will fall,

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,200
their popularity will fall and that will increase

139
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,240
Reform's leads in polling, and that will increase

140
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,840
the Reform's likelihood of winning the next election.

141
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,440
So I think because the economic worsening is not

142
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,320
baked into these statistics, I think Reform's chances

143
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,640
of winning the next election are significantly

144
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,080
higher than the betting market thinks of 50%.

145
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,120
One other thing I should add to that is

146
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,880
when you... If we look historically, this economic

147
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,400
worsening is going to make Labour more unpopular, but

148
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,200
there is a really strong historical trend of at times

149
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,440
of economic weakness, especially prolonged economic

150
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,480
weakness, really strong demand from the public for the

151
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,880
far right, and also for leaders who give a sense

152
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,760
of strength, strong-seeming leaders, especially

153
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,120
leaders who are sort of strong and on our side.

154
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,760
And that is very much the vibe that Farage is going for.

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,880
And at the moment, none of the other parties,

156
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,240
none of the other main parties, Conservatives

157
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,480
or Labour, have really been able to do that.

158
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,600
So as the economy weakens, really further

159
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
economic weakness is terrible for

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,280
Labour and it's just great for Reform.

161
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,400
So I think they have much better chance

162
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,840
than the betting market suggests.

163
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,760
So as that happens, as time passes, Reform's...

164
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,400
Unless Reform do something crazy or there's

165
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,520
some massive scandal, which is definitely

166
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,080
possible because I think there are some

167
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,480
perhaps slightly rogue guys in their party.

168
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,920
If that doesn't happen, I think Reform's

169
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,720
odds will go up and up and up and up and up.

170
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,320
And then that will force the other parties to react.

171
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,280
Because as time passes, it will become more

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,960
and more obvious that Labour are going to lose.

173
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,800
The Conservatives are already in a very weak place.

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,960
And as it becomes clear they're losing,

175
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,600
they will have to move.

176
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
So what will they do?

177
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,960
So Labour... Labour are in interesting situation.

178
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,280
They have a budget coming up in November.

179
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,240
Their economic situation is terrible.

180
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,600
They're probably going to significantly

181
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,880
raise taxes in the autumn.

182
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,200
They're not going to go for popular taxes

183
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
like the wealth tax, like taxes we support.

184
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,280
They're probably going

185
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,560
to go on taxes on the middle class.

186
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,320
They might go on taxes on working people.

187
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,480
I think it's going to be very difficult for them

188
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,880
to do that and not take a big hit in popularity.

189
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,200
Then in May, we will have local elections,

190
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,920
Including here in London, and I

191
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
think they will do really, really badly.

192
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,640
So I think that Labour are... Firstly,

193
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,480
they're already polling really badly.

194
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,200
Keir Starmer, the leader, polls really badly.

195
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,800
And they're about to go into two like really bad

196
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,160
events basically, a really bad autumn budget

197
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,840
in November, and a really bad election in May.

198
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,680
So, basically, Labour are in a really

199
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,560
bad situation, which is about to worsen.

200
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,240
And what that means is the same thing that

201
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,920
I've said for a long time, because I've

202
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,680
always predicted this would happen to Labour.

203
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,160
Keir Starmer's popularity will collapse.

204
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,960
Labour's popularity will collapse, and Labour

205
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,240
will be forced into a massive rebrand,

206
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
which is going to change the leadership.

207
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,560
And we can actually look at this

208
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,880
in the betting markets as well.

209
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,120
So, if we flash it up, you can look at the betting

210
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,320
market, when will Keir Starmer leave?

211
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,560
And if you look at it now, at this point, it thinks that

212
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,400
Keir Starmer will be lucky if he survives next year.

213
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
And I think that there is a good

214
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,120
chance that Keir Starmer will go next year.

215
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,320
We don't know for sure it'll be next year.

216
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
The betting market here reckons the chance of him

217
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,400
surviving to the next election are about something

218
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,400
like 16%, which is obviously very, very low.

219
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,320
So, we can't say for certain,

220
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,760
but I think I'm pretty confident.

221
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,800
Keir Starmer will go, Keir Starmer will

222
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,920
be replaced, and there'll be a new leader.

223
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,320
Now this... And again, I've said it for even since

224
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,480
before Labour came in that this is what would happen.

225
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,040
This is a massive opportunity for us because there

226
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,720
will be a new Labour leader probably next year.

227
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
We don't know exactly when.

228
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,560
And when that leader comes in, he or she will

229
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,880
have to come in with some kind of brand, some

230
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,840
kind of message, some kind of story, right?

231
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,320
They will have to say, "I am Mr. or Mrs. X.

232
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,560
I stand for Y.

233
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,360
My plan for the future of this country is

234
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,840
Z." And in particular, because the economy

235
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,440
continues to worsen, they will have to have a

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,280
very clear vision and a very clear picture on

237
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,400
what they were going to do for the economy.

238
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,560
And when they come in, they will have to look around

239
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,560
at all the different ideas about how we should

240
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,880
manage the economy, and they will have to pick one.

241
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,320
And they say, "This is going to

242
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,320
be the brand which identifies me.

243
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,280
This is the kind of economic leader I am.

244
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,760
This is the kind of economic future I want for

245
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,800
the country." And this is going to be a massive,

246
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,320
massive opportunity for me, for us, for this

247
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,120
channel, because I think personally, if you are

248
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,680
a new Labour leader coming in now, and you want to

249
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,080
win the election, the best economic strategy for

250
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,080
you to pick is wealth taxes, is inequality,

251
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,480
is to try to coop to me, try to coop my voice.

252
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,880
Because really, this is the simple

253
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,280
question, is, "What the **** else is there?"

254
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,240
I don't think you can go running on what Labour

255
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,000
and what Keir Starmer have been running on up

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,480
till now, which is just, "We are really sensible.

257
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,400
We're going to try and sensible our way out of this.

258
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,800
We're going to try and grow, grow, grow

259
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,200
our way out of this." Because it's really

260
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,920
clear that that is the existing status quo.

261
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,120
That's what governments have tried to do for 20 years.

262
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
It hasn't worked.

263
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,280
It's not working.

264
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,960
It's not working for Keir Starmer.

265
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,480
So they have to do something new.

266
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,520
We have to basically position ourselves

267
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,400
that when the new Labour leader comes in, they look

268
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,880
around the world of economic ideas, and they say,

269
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,400
"The one that is going to win us the next election

270
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,760
is inequality, is wealth taxes, is that stuff

271
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,400
supported by Garys Economics and Gabriel Zucman and

272
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,520
Patriotic Millionaires." We have to be that voice.

273
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,760
It's a massive opportunity for us.

274
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,560
If they choose that, I think they can win the

275
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,440
next election, which means I think Reform will

276
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,280
lose the next election. Will they choose it?

277
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,640
So I think it's an obvious choice

278
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,160
I think it's an obvious choice if they want to win.

279
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,320
I don't think Labour are great, so

280
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,360
they might not make the right choice.

281
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,280
There's a couple of other choices they can make.

282
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,160
The other choice is to kind of double down on this

283
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,360
Mr. Sensible, Keir Starmer sensible Labour stuff.

284
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,200
Grow, grow, grow.

285
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
It sounds great.

286
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,960
It's... If you're a very boring person, it's...

287
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I don't think it's going to win the public.

288
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
It hasn't worked for Keir Starmer.

289
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,920
It didn't work for Biden and Kamala.

290
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,440
It will be very unoriginal, it will be very uninspiring.

291
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,040
I think you're handing the

292
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,600
battle over to the right.

293
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,200
There is another choice they can make, which I think

294
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,760
is a good chance the choice that they will make, which

295
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,760
is to come in very anti-immigration, and that is because

296
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,160
at the moment, the big salience is on immigration.

297
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,080
They're worried about Reform, and they could say,

298
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,960
"Okay, well, we are going to go on the issue which

299
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,200
everybody's talking about, which is immigration." If

300
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,960
they do this, it brings up the issues that I spoke about

301
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,520
in the video from two weeks ago about storytelling and

302
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,240
salience and wedge issues, which is immigration is the

303
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,760
issue upon which Labour is weak and Reform is strong.

304
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,520
So if Labour chooses to make immigration its defining

305
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,800
economic policy, it's basically signing its own death

306
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
warrant because it basically guarantees that the entire

307
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,120
economic debate between the new leadership coming in

308
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,400
and the election will constantly be the issue about

309
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,320
which Labour is weak and Reform are strong.

310
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,640
So, basically, I think when the new Labour leader

311
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,320
comes in, he's going to have three choices.

312
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
Either move... try and shift salience towards

313
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,000
inequality, distribution, which is the

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
issue on, on which Labour is strong.

315
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,200
Well, it could try to become strong.

316
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,440
We are strong, and if they try to use our voice,

317
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,520
they could become strong and Reform is weak.

318
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,320
Or it can continue on its sort of nothing, nothing

319
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
boring path, which I think is a death warrant.

320
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,960
Or it can choose to aggressively raise the

321
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,400
salience upon which its opponent is strong,

322
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,160
which I think is a failure as well.

323
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,680
If they come to us, I think they can win.

324
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,720
I hope they will.

325
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm going to try everything to make sure that they do

326
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,680
That's going to be our main

327
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,520
priority, here on this channel.

328
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,200
Unfortunately, I think they probably

329
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,760
won't, which means I think they'll probably

330
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,480
end up choosing the immigration option, which

331
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,360
means Reform will win the next election.

332
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,320
Okay, so next is the Conservatives.

333
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,360
So the Conservatives are still in there with a chance.

334
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,640
The betting market does think they have a 12% chance

335
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,800
of winning the next election, getting the most seats.

336
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,960
Which is interesting, right?

337
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,920
Because it's not zero.

338
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
And at the moment, like there's a

339
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,840
lot of talk "Conservatives are dead."

340
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,760
Their leader is also unpopular despite

341
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,400
the Prime Minister's unpopularity.

342
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
They're basically having their space aggressively

343
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
usurped by Reform, and it looks like the

344
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,440
party basically is at risk of disappearing.

345
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,000
So why have they got the 12%?

346
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,280
Okay, Reform... Conservatives also... Again,

347
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,720
we can look in the betting market and we can see

348
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,400
betting market thinks the Conservatives will almost

349
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,080
certainly change their leader as well next year.

350
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,400
So we can see here that the... Kemi Badenoch

351
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,400
also less than 50% chance of surviving next year.

352
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,560
They'll bring a new leader in.

353
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,320
It looks like it will be probably Robert Jenrick.

354
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,360
We're not sure.

355
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,640
There's this interesting thing that happens in games,

356
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,440
which is when you are losing a game, especially

357
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,520
when you are losing a game quite aggressively,

358
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,040
being kind of crazy becomes an optimal strategy.

359
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
And the reason for that is probably best understood

360
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,120
by looking at it from the flipped perspective,

361
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,720
which is imagine I'm comfortably winning a game.

362
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,920
I know as long as nothing crazy happens,

363
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,120
the game will be predictable and I will win.

364
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,040
So people who are winning want

365
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,920
predictability, which means what people

366
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,360
who are losing want is unpredictability.

367
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,040
And I think as we get closer and closer to that

368
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,960
election, at the moment the Conservatives are

369
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,120
kind of biding their time, thinking about the new

370
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,280
leader, hoping that Reform do something crazy,

371
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,920
**** it up somehow, get like a big scandal.

372
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
And then Robert Jenrick is going to come in,

373
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,080
basically again, very hard on immigration

374
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,600
and hope that they can take the place

375
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,120
that Reform lose by sort of ******* it up.

376
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
If Reform don't **** it up, as we get closer to the

377
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,080
election, the Conservatives will be more and more in

378
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,760
a situation where they have to do something crazy and

379
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,040
really I'm kind of interested to see what they do.

380
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,280
You will probably see more and more and more kind

381
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,960
of wild and erratic behavior from the Conservatives

382
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
as we approach the election because they are

383
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,920
kind of facing basically an existential threat.

384
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,680
There's a good chance that

385
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,240
they will disappear as a party.

386
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,000
And that 12% is basically the 12% chance of, will

387
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,560
the Tories do something crazy which is somehow popular.

388
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,680
I think it's unlikely, but we'll see.

389
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,000
There's a couple of other parties

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,920
that I should mention, right?

391
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,760
Which is the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.

392
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,520
If I'm honest, I think the Liberal

393
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,880
Democrat situation is relatively uninteresting.

394
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,920
The Liberal Democrats are... I

395
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,840
don't dislike the Liberal Democrats.

396
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,120
The Liberal Democrats are an interesting

397
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,800
party because they compete not exclusively,

398
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,600
but almost exclusively with the Conservatives.

399
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,720
And that is because their voters are largely richer

400
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,800
people who would otherwise vote for Conservatives.

401
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,040
Because the Conservatives did so badly in the last

402
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,920
election, the Liberal Democrats won like almost all of

403
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
their seats that they compete with the Conservatives.

404
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,480
I think they'll probably just do that again.

405
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,640
The big space really at the moment is who fills

406
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,560
the space that has been basically vacated by

407
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,680
the enormous decrease in popularity of Labour.

408
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,480
And that is where the Greens are quite interesting,

409
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,080
which is the Greens now have this new leader, Zach

410
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,000
Polanski, who is making like, quite a conscious pitch,

411
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,160
which is I'm going to fill that space vacated by Labour.

412
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,920
Labour have been sort of moving slowly

413
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,240
right as they sort of try and chase Reform.

414
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,640
Their popularity has collapsed.

415
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,000
And then there's this space which comes up for like,

416
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,640
"Well, we are going to be a party which is like broadly

417
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,320
left." And I've constantly said I think that

418
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,080
there's really a space for a popular party which

419
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,760
focuses the economy, focuses inequality, focuses

420
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,840
wealth tax, and also aggressively focuses on social

421
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,840
media where there's a lot of political power.

422
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,600
And this new guy, Zack Polansky in the Greens, seems to

423
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,640
be... It almost feels like he's just been watching this

424
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,480
channel and he's like, "Yeah, that's a good policy.

425
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm going to do that." So it's... I think the Greens

426
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,920
have the potential to take a huge amount of seats.

427
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,480
Because of the massive unpopularity of Labour,

428
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,160
they're like an obvious guys who could fill that gap.

429
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,680
The new leader, Zack Polansky, talks about

430
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,920
30 to 40 seats, which would be enormous for

431
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,720
the Greens, who have never had more than four

432
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,560
seats, which is what they won last election.

433
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,400
It's optimistic, but I think it's possible

434
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,040
for the reason that I highlighted before,

435
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,240
which is Labour's popularity is going to tank.

436
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,000
The risk to the Greens is basically the thing that

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,080
we want, which is if the Greens manage to get popularity

438
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,520
on this idea of basically wealth taxes on inequality,

439
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,240
the new leader of Labour might try to usurp that

440
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,680
space, in which case it would really smash the Greens.

441
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,040
But I mean, if what you want is wealth taxes

442
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,520
on inequality, then what you kind of really want

443
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,200
is for the Greens to do this interesting thing

444
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,120
where they push a policy with the hope that Labour

445
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,560
adopt it, which would lead to the Greens losing.

446
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,200
It's this really interesting situation the Greens are

447
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,080
in, which is the best thing they can do for the country

448
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,960
is kind of intentionally lose, because they want to

449
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,920
drag Labour back into a kind of sensible policy space.

450
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,120
And this is... What I think is really interesting here

451
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,920
is that the Greens are now in the kind of situation

452
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,080
that Nigel Farage was in for, like, the last 20 years.

453
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,280
So, Nigel Farage, some people might not know,

454
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,320
he's the leader of the Reform Party, and before

455
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,080
Reform, he was leader of a party called UKIP.

456
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,200
And he only won his first seat

457
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,720
in Parliament last year, in 2024.

458
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,520
But despite that, Nigel Farage is almost

459
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,640
single-handedly the man responsible for Brexit.

460
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,440
And what that means, it's because he has been

461
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,840
doing basically exactly what I suggested the

462
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,680
Greens need to do, which is... He's constantly

463
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,320
been forcing the Conservatives to come towards

464
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,120
his direction without ever winning any seats.

465
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,320
Because he can keep saying, "Well, I'm going to win

466
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,520
4 million, 5 million votes, and you're going to lose

467
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,280
the election unless you come across." And I think

468
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,800
Farage shows what I would like, sort of, the Greens

469
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,040
and Green supporters to realise, which is, under our

470
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,800
kind of stupid political system, where every election

471
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,520
is an election where only two parties can't win,

472
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,840
as a smaller party, it is impossible for you to win.

473
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,440
But it is possible for you to dominate the political

474
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,280
narrative by influencing the main political parties.

475
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,760
And this brings us to... brings me to the next point I

476
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,560
want to make, which is, I think the only way, really,

477
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,920
that I can see Reform not winning this election

478
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,640
is either Labour come across under their new leadership

479
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,800
and they adopt inequality as

480
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,720
their policy message, or the Greens are

481
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,000
so successful that they bring Labour across.

482
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,560
And the truth is, I don't think either of

483
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,920
those things are likely to happen, which

484
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,520
means, that I basically think Reform are

485
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,040
probably going to win the next election.

486
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,840
But if you do want it to happen...

487
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,240
Because I know that a lot of my viewers will

488
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
probably not want Reform to win the next election.

489
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,040
If you do want that to happen, if you want

490
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,960
Reform not to win the next election, what do you do?

491
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,160
So I was speaking to my brother this week,

492
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,680
and he... he doesn't like me mentioning him

493
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,880
on the channel, so probably won't be happy.

494
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,520
But he said something.

495
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
He's an interesting guy, my brother.

496
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,200
He said something interesting,

497
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,240
which I was speaking to him about.

498
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,600
You know, "Do you think Reform will win the next

499
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,880
election?" And he agreed with me and said, "Probably

500
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,760
yes." And I was like, "Do think there's any way

501
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,320
that Reform could be stopped?" And he just said one

502
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,880
line, which was, "Aggressive and relentless pursuit

503
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,360
of unity and common ground." That's all that he said

504
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,280
This is the kind of thing that he says.

505
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,640
And in a sense, that's what I've just

506
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,600
said, which is basically unless the Greens

507
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,000
and Labour, the party on the left and the party of

508
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,720
the centre, both move into this space of focus

509
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,000
on the economy, focus on inequality, deal with

510
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,800
taxation, then Reform will win the election.

511
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,920
And at this point, I should probably also

512
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,120
mention there is obviously a third party.

513
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,040
There's the, the new party, which doesn't have a name

514
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,280
yet, which is led by Corbyn and Sultana, which...

515
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
They're behind wealth taxes as well, right.

516
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,960
These guys have also popped up.

517
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,480
The truth is we are going into the next election,

518
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,160
Reform will be strong favorites.

519
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,400
And really, whether Reform win or not will be decided

520
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,040
by whether these different groups of people, these

521
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,880
different groups of voters are able to do,

522
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,080
as my brother said... He's going to hate

523
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,960
me from keeping on mentioning him.

524
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
Aggressive and relentless pursuit

525
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,120
of unity and common ground.

526
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,040
It's as simple as that, basically.

527
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,920
We have, especially in this country, a political

528
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,840
system which aggressively punishes division.

529
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,560
Aggressively, aggressively punishes division.

530
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,920
What will probably happen in the next election

531
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,160
is that Reform will win an overall majority

532
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,120
with the smallest ever number of votes that

533
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,000
any party has ever won an overall majority.

534
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
And that will be simply because

535
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,200
the people and the politicians in this

536
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,320
country who do not support Reform are divided.

537
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,200
We have a political system, first past the post,

538
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,120
which as an aside, I think is a stupid political system.

539
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Maybe I'll talk a video about it one time.

540
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,400
That voting system, that political system aggressively,

541
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,360
aggressively, aggressively punishes division.

542
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,800
So whether Reform win or not is basically a

543
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,120
question of will the centre and will the left

544
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,600
be able to be aggressive and relentless

545
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,840
in their pursuit of common ground?

546
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,920
And, I would love for them to unite on the issues

547
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,040
which they have in common, which I would like to

548
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,120
believe are fixing the economy...... dealing with

549
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,960
inequality, dealing with an unfair taxation system.

550
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,560
In reality, I don't think these various

551
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,080
groups are going to be able to do that.

552
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,280
And unfortunately, that's just simply because

553
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,360
there's a lot of bad blood and a lot of antipathy

554
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,760
between the centre and the left,

555
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,400
and that goes in both directions.

556
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
If they are able to be sensible, get their heads

557
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,080
together, focus on the message that will win,

558
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,680
which is inequality, distribution, the economy,

559
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,480
focus aggressively on their common ground, try

560
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,120
to avoid bickering and raising the salience

561
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,000
of their differences, try to avoid raising the

562
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,960
salience of their opponents, then they can win.

563
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,720
If they're divided, they will lose.

564
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,520
Okay, so that's my prediction.

565
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,920
I do think Reform will win the next election.

566
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,040
I think that will be clearer as time goes on.

567
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,720
Really, the big dice that is yet to roll

568
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,520
is Labour's rebrand and Labour's new leadership.

569
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
And in particular, what they

570
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,640
choose as their economic message.

571
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,800
I've been talking to Labour.

572
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,840
I'm not that popular.

573
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,320
I'm... They're not

574
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,400
that popular with me either.

575
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,480
I don't think that much of them, but I say that.

576
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,760
Like, I want them to win because I think we have a

577
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,200
much better chance of getting wealth taxes with them

578
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,520
than with Reform, but I don't think that they will.

579
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,040
I think they will...

580
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,400
I think they'll kind of **** it up.

581
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,880
I think they'll probably choose migration.

582
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,640
I think they'll end up

583
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
just boosting the salience of their opponents.

584
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,840
And I think Reform and Farage

585
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,880
will win the next election.

586
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,560
So, what do we think about that?

587
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,160
Now, this is quite difficult to talk about, right?

588
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,120
Because I try really, really hard on

589
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,280
this channel to be non-politically partisan.

590
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,240
I am a single-issue channel.

591
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm an economist.

592
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
I think the issue is inequality, and it's

593
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,280
about wealth taxes, so how do we do that?

594
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,360
And I try my best and I genuinely want this

595
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,280
channel to be watched by people on all sides of the

596
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,800
political spectrum, including Reform voters.

597
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,200
And the country is becoming so divided at the moment

598
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,440
between people who like Farage and Reform and people

599
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,920
who don't, that it's very difficult to send a message

600
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,760
that will reach and be listened to all my viewers.

601
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,000
Because I know we're listened to

602
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,880
by people who are on both sides of this.

603
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,480
So, I'm going to send... I'm going to try to split

604
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,280
my message up into basically two parts.

605
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,680
One for people who don't want Reform to win and

606
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
then one for people who are maybe supporting Reform.

607
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,520
Okay, so if you don't want Farage to win, and again

608
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,840
we're going to have to split this message up now between

609
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,680
the people in the centre, people who might...

610
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,720
if you want to know who's on the centre, it's, you know.

611
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,920
Do you like Keir Starmer?

612
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,360
Do you like the current Labour Party?

613
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,640
Do you like Tony Blair?

614
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
You know, these kind of people

615
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,040
who like that kind of status quo.

616
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,200
What do we want to say to them?

617
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
And then we're going to talk to people

618
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,960
on the left, so people who might like

619
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,360
Zach Polanski, might like Jeremy Corbyn.

620
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,080
What do we... What are the

621
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,600
risks to both of these groups?

622
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,080
Okay.

623
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,000
If you're on the centre, and you

624
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,960
want... Presumably you want Labour to win.

625
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,200
The way that you will lose this next election

626
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,800
is by either persisting with a status quo

627
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,640
economic policy which has no salience, no cut

628
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,880
through, no narrative, or by moving aggressively

629
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,280
towards constantly talking about immigration and

630
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,880
aggressively raising the salience of your opponents.

631
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,760
You need a message which is

632
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,400
different from Reform's message.

633
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,960
If your message is Reform's message,

634
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,920
Reform will win the next election.

635
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,720
So, that's it.

636
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
You need your own message.

637
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,920
You need your own voice.

638
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,120
You need something that's popular.

639
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,560
And I'm building it for you here.

640
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,040
If you want to win the next election and

641
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,600
you're on the centre, you don't need to

642
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,520
change your opinions on everything, but you

643
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,720
do need to be open to doing something on

644
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,360
inequality, on wealth taxes, on the economy.

645
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,760
You want to be saying, "We're going to raise

646
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,640
taxes on the super rich so that we can cut tax

647
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,120
on workers." That will boost your economy.

648
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,040
That will make you popular.

649
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,880
That is how you win.

650
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,560
That is how you win.

651
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,400
And I want you to be really, really mindful

652
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,560
of that when you're thinking about who is the

653
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,160
next Labour leader and what should he support?

654
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,800
Now, if you're on the left, I think the real risk

655
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,240
to the left at this point is with the real growth,

656
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,640
the aggressive growth in the popularity

657
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,720
of Farage and Reform and things like the march

658
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,240
which happened last weekend, I think there is a

659
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,040
risk that the left gets very, very angry and starts

660
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,440
to be really, really aggressive and accusatory

661
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,280
towards people who might be voting for Reform.

662
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
I want to show you a clip which I

663
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,880
saw on PoliticsJOE the other weekend.

664
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,040
So, let's run it.

665
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,720
This is PoliticsJOE, talking to some

666
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,640
Reform, you know, passionate supporters,

667
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,880
people who've gone to the conference.

668
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,280
Let's see what they're saying.

669
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,600
Wealth tax or no wealth tax?

670
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,400
It's a very hard one.

671
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,280
I mean, I come from a working class town.

672
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,480
Everything in kind of Reform's policies would

673
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,000
maybe leaning more towards no wealth tax.

674
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,480
So, for me, if the wealth tax was possible, I'm at a

675
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,120
stage in my politics where I would actually support it.

676
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,280
There are a lot of Reform voters

677
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,000
who'd be supportive of wealth taxes.

678
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,360
I know that a lot of people are scared of

679
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,440
the growth of Reform, and the truth is, I

680
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,240
am scared of the growth of Reform as well.

681
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,400
I know that a lot of people who watch this channel

682
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
who see themselves as from the left are probably

683
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,880
people who are very interested in politics,

684
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,440
people who are very knowledgeable about politics.

685
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,320
Just the very fact that you're here watching

686
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,160
this video means you are probably somebody who is

687
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,440
interested in and knowledgeable about politics.

688
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
I would like you to understand that the vast majority

689
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,800
of people in this country are not experts in politics.

690
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,440
They read very little about politics.

691
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,320
They have not spent loads and loads

692
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,560
of time thinking and researching politics.

693
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,840
And they get their information from

694
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,760
the media or from social media.

695
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,560
And what they have been told and are being told

696
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,720
consistently in the media is that the reason you are

697
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,680
poor, the reason your kids can't get a house, the

698
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,720
reason you can't get a job is because of immigration

699
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
or because of illegal immigration, because of refugees.

700
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
That's what they're being told.

701
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,160
They're being told that again and

702
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,920
again and again and again and again.

703
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,760
So, this is where they are.

704
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,400
This is what they think.

705
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,480
This is what they're being told.

706
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,280
They think that the reason they're

707
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,920
being poor is because of immigration.

708
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,360
And if they go to a protest or, you

709
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,440
know, they speak online about this and

710
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,920
somebody gets in their face and calls them

711
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,000
a racist, that's not going to win them over.

712
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,920
You are not going to win

713
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,040
these people over like that.

714
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,960
I totally understand the instinct of people on the

715
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,920
left to worry about increasing racism in society.

716
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
I think it's happening.

717
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
I can feel it happening. You need to

718
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,560
be pragmatic, you need to be sensible.

719
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,160
If you want to get progressive change in the next

720
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,920
election, you need to win people over, and I think

721
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,440
you need to be really careful to resist the temptation

722
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,640
to go around shouting at people, calling them racists.

723
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,440
Listen, there are racists in this country.

724
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,280
There always have been racists in this country.

725
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,000
There's always been 100,000, 200,000 people who vote

726
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,480
for the BNP and might have been voted by racism.

727
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,440
Might have been... Sorry, motivated by racism.

728
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
Reform are going to win the next election,

729
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,280
and you are not going to stop that by

730
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,120
turning around and calling people racists.

731
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
What you need to do... And I know this might not be

732
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,600
pleasant for some of you... I think my brother's right.

733
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,360
You need to be relentless and aggressive in your

734
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,800
pursuit of common ground and unity, and that means

735
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,960
you're willing to go to people who you might not

736
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,600
agree with everything about and say, "Listen, I

737
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,680
know we don't agree on everything, but let's find

738
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,520
the thing that we do agree on, and let's fight

739
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,760
for that." Because those people at those protests,

740
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,600
they, just like you, are struggling to pay the rent.

741
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,200
Their kids are struggling to pay the rent.

742
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
They're struggling to find economic futures.

743
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,240
If you centre that, if you focus on

744
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,880
that, you can build something positive.

745
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
You can win them over.

746
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,000
If you focus on what divides you, all you're going

747
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
to do is make this country more and more divided.

748
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,400
So that, that's it, you know.

749
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,920
I think really, in politics,

750
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,200
as in history, division loses.

751
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,920
I think you can afford to find your differences

752
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,200
and fight over them when you are winning.

753
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,720
If you are losing, you need to find unity.

754
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,680
And it's as simple as that, basically.

755
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,800
If people on the left and on the centre

756
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,360
are able to be aggressive and relentless in

757
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,320
their pursuit of common ground, they can win,

758
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,280
and I think that common ground is the economy.

759
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,440
I think it's inequality.

760
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,200
I don't see any other way of stopping Reform.

761
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,800
So, if that's what you want to do, if you want

762
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,040
to stop Reform, if you want to see a more equal

763
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,920
country, you need to focus on that in your arguments.

764
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,280
Find that common ground.

765
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,240
Focus on your common ground and

766
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,640
unity when you speak to other people.

767
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,920
So I'm going to have a word for people who

768
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,320
want Reform to win, but before that, I just want to

769
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,200
talk a little bit about what happens if Reform do win.

770
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,000
And I know we have viewers all over the country.

771
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,160
It's not just Reform here, because the far-right

772
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,680
are winning and are about to win all over the world.

773
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,960
You know, my big concern if Reform win

774
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,240
is not actually really Farage and Reform.

775
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
It's not, it's not the current far-right.

776
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,840
I know these guys get called fascists

777
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,120
and they get called racists.

778
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,080
I don't think they are all fascists and racists.

779
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,920
My big concern is that when Reform get into

780
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,560
power, the same thing will happen to Reform

781
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,880
as what happened to Labour, what happened

782
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,080
to Rishi Sunak, what has happened to Trump.

783
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,200
Even what happened to Biden.

784
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,720
What has happened to basically every

785
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,520
politician and political party in the last 15 years.

786
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,760
They come in.

787
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,240
They don't deal with the fundamental economic

788
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,920
problem, which is growing inequality.

789
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,720
Living standards worsen, and then they find themself

790
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,080
in the same situation Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer

791
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,360
found themselves in, which is like, "Okay, we're in.

792
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
We're failing on the economy.

793
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,160
We're super unpopular.

794
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,600
We need to roll the dice.

795
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,720
We need to rebrand.

796
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,440
What do we do?" And you have this situation here

797
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,520
where Labour are kind of stuck in the centre, and when

798
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,000
you're in the centre, you don't really know where to go.

799
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,440
I said this about Trump before you came

800
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,800
in, and I think it's proving true,

801
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
and I'll say the same about Reform.

802
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,680
It's when they come in, their

803
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,440
economic policies aren't working.

804
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,000
The obvious political move is to say, "This is because

805
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,600
we are not going far enough on immigration." I think

806
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,000
it's a... It's just the re- It's just so... And you

807
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,680
can say, "Look, it's because we're being blocked.

808
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,720
Labour are blocking us, or the courts are blocking us,

809
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,560
or the European Court of Human Rights are blocking

810
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,320
us, or the academics are blocking us, or the lefties

811
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,080
are blocking us, or The Guardian's blocking us." And

812
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,240
you can say, "The reason that the economy is not

813
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,000
working is because we are not being aggressive enough

814
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,200
on immigration." So, at the moment, the emphasis

815
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,480
is on illegal immigration or asylum seekers.

816
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,680
And, okay, you leave the European... You

817
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,640
leave the European Court of Human Rights,

818
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
you know, the Convention on Refugees, and

819
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,560
you say, "The UK doesn't accept any refugees.

820
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,600
Done." That's not going to fix the economy.

821
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,320
I guarantee you.

822
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,440
I'll bet you any money that will not fix the economy.

823
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Then you say, "Okay, well, you know, the

824
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,480
reason for that is because, you know, that

825
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,520
was just one part of migration, you know?

826
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,160
Look at all the enormous amounts of legal migration,

827
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,200
and legal migration is much, much, much bigger

828
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,800
than asylum seeking." So, okay, we need to get

829
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,120
rid of legal migration, and if you do that,

830
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,440
that's not going to fix the economic problems.

831
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
So, you get rid of legal migration.

832
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,800
You're still not fixing the economic problem.

833
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
What do you do next?

834
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,640
Well, the obvious place to go next is to

835
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
say, "Well, that wasn't enough because we've

836
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,920
already had too much migration" right.

837
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,960
So you go back and you look at people who have recently

838
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,880
migrated in the last five years, in the last 10

839
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,840
years, and you say, "Okay, we need to get rid

840
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,440
of recent migrants." You know, these people

841
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,040
might be British citizens in many cases.

842
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,560
They might have permanent residency.

843
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,440
So you start to kick out recent... recent migrants.

844
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,080
What if that doesn't work?

845
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,520
You know, what... My real concern is

846
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,920
this can keep going further and then

847
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,760
you can start scapegoating more groups.

848
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,920
You know, there was a clip online.

849
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,040
Did you see that clip with the American...

850
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,600
with the Fox News anchor saying he

851
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,000
thinks we should kill homeless people?

852
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,440
[Jack] What?

853
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,080
[Gary] Let's get this one up.

854
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,600
Okay.

855
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,000
Yes, there was a clip on the

856
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
right-wing American station recently,

857
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,120
Fox News, where they're talking about how to

858
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,920
deal with the problem of homelessness.

859
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
This is, you know, this is not the future.

860
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,080
This is today.

861
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,160
Either you take the resources that we're going to

862
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,040
give you and... Or you decide that you gotta be locked

863
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,840
up in jail, that's the way it has to be now.

864
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,600
Or involuntary lethal injection- Yeah or something.

865
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,280
Just kill 'em.

866
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,880
Yeah, Brian, why did it have to get to this point?

867
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,600
Right?

868
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
You know, the... I think this...

869
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,680
That really happened, by the way.

870
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,280
This is a really genuine thing that happened

871
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,400
in the US, which is a Fox News host

872
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,200
suggested that the way to deal with the problem of

873
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,480
homelessness is to execute all the homeless people.

874
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,680
So, I... And I'm not... Listen, I'm not saying that

875
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,760
Farage wants this, you know, and I'm not saying even

876
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,280
that Trump wants this, but, when your plan to deal with

877
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,520
the economy is to scapegoat a group of people, and

878
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,400
then you hit that group of people, you kick them out of

879
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,920
the country and it doesn't work, and you're unpopular,

880
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,840
the obvious thing to do next is to go harder.

881
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,640
And you're seeing this now in... You're seeing on the

882
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,200
biggest news channel in the US, anchors suggesting

883
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,160
the thing to do is to murder all the homeless people.

884
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,960
Listen, I'm not saying Farage wants to do that, right?

885
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm an economist.

886
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,160
I think Farage will win the next election.

887
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,800
They will fail on the economy.

888
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,720
The obvious political move will to be...

889
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,960
be to go further, and I am very, very worried

890
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,120
about where this could go in the end.

891
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,680
And I would like that hopefully to

892
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,200
sharpen your mind, both if you want

893
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Farage to win and if you don't want Farage to win.

894
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,280
But listen, if they win, I think we do need to be

895
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,680
ready for this because I think they probably will win.

896
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,920
There would also be massive political opportunity,

897
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,000
which is the sense that, at the moment, Farage has

898
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,640
the phenomenal strength of never having been in

899
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,880
power, which means that he cannot be blamed for

900
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,840
any of the economic weaknesses that the UK is in.

901
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,240
Because the Conservatives were

902
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,200
in for 14 years, they failed.

903
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,440
Labour have been in for a year, they

904
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,840
are failing and will keep failing.

905
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,080
And he has this ability to say, "Well, I have this

906
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,160
magic bullet and it's going to work." When he comes

907
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,120
in, just as Trump has just come in, living standards

908
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,920
will keep falling and we need to be ready to say what

909
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,840
I've always said, which is, "This is what will happen

910
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,640
if you don't deal with inequality." Until and unless

911
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,000
we have a powerful and cohesive narrative, a

912
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
powerful story, which I think should be about

913
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,560
inequality and about billionaires, the only

914
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,960
political space, because the centre is obviously

915
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
failing, will be to go further and further Right.

916
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,440
Okay.

917
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,480
Now, I want to go on to

918
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,960
the people who want Reform to win.

919
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,600
I went on LBC yesterday, on Tom

920
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,200
Swarbrick's show, I did a live phone in.

921
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,000
And, somebody called in and he said... he said

922
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,880
that he wa- he's a fan of the channel, so he might be

923
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,760
out there watching today, and he says he enjoys

924
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,360
the videos and he enjoys the stuff that we put out.

925
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,960
But he said to me, "You're not going to win

926
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,160
because what I care about is immigration and,

927
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,480
and there's millions of us in this country

928
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,680
that what we care about is immigration.

929
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,760
And maybe not you," talking to me, "Maybe not

930
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,440
you, Gary, you don't maybe do this, but your

931
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,880
supporters, they turn around to us and

932
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,920
they call us bigots and they call us racists.

933
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,080
And I'm not a racist, I just...

934
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm just worried about immigration.

935
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,240
I want there to be less immigration."

936
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,920
This is what this guy said to me.

937
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,880
And I just want to make it very, very clear

938
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,920
because I know probably if you are a Reform

939
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,320
voter, you might be hearing things online about

940
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,760
me, that I'm a radical leftist or whatever.

941
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,040
There is a space for you here.

942
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,360
I do this for you.

943
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,040
Not just only for you, but I do this for all of the

944
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,400
hardworking men and women in this country and across

945
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,560
the world who see their living standards falling.

946
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,320
Okay?

947
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,920
I know it's broken, I know it's not working, and I

948
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,040
know when you look at the politicians around you,

949
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,560
you see a lot of people who think you're pretty ****.

950
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,760
And if honest... if I'm honest

951
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,960
I think the same thing as you.

952
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I understand that.

953
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,800
I understand that.

954
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,840
And that's exactly why I do what I do.

955
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,520
I walked away from a lot of money to do this

956
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,600
because I could see the way the country was going.

957
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,240
I know that there's not a lot of

958
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,000
great political leaders out there.

959
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,960
I don't trust the guys that are leading it.

960
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,160
They are very, very wealthy people.

961
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
They're funded by very, very wealthy people.

962
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,560
Their plan is to cut the taxes of very, very wealthy

963
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,520
people and to fund that by cutting your public services,

964
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,760
your education, the NHS, the things that you need.

965
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,680
That's not going to work out well for you and your kids.

966
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,320
There's a space for you here.

967
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,400
I don't take sides.

968
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,680
I'm an economist.

969
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,280
I do what I do for the future of this country,

970
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,400
for the future of ordinary people like you,

971
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,280
families like yours, your kids, your grandkids.

972
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,920
I'm a very good economist.

973
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,520
I've got a very good track record.

974
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,120
I've got a lot of educational videos, which

975
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,960
I'll put up here for free, which you can watch

976
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,400
for free to understand what's happening.

977
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,000
If you do not deal with growing inequality, the

978
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,960
living standards of your kids and your grandkids

979
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,240
will get worse and worse and worse and worse.

980
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,000
There's a space for you here.

981
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,280
And I know when I, when I say that, that I don't

982
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
trust your leaders, you're going to turn around and

983
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,240
you're going to point to Keir Starmer and you're

984
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,200
going to say, "Well, I don't trust him either."

985
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,160
And the truth is, I agree with you.

986
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,880
I wish we had more good political leaders.

987
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,200
And at the moment, maybe we don't.

988
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm working hard to build that

989
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,480
and I would like your support.

990
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,560
We're building something here that's

991
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,760
going to put more money in your pocket, that's

992
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,640
going to mean your kids can have homes.

993
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,480
But there's something else I need say as well.

994
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,920
Listen, I'm from London and I grew up in a very

995
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,640
multicultural place with lots of people, lots of

996
00:41:50,640 --> 00:42:01,240
different colours, lots of different countries.

997
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,520
And last weekend, I had friends who were scared to leave

998
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,600
the house, were scared to walk on the streets of London.

999
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,480
And that's because they think you're racists.

1000
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,440
That's what they think.

1001
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,320
And I tell those people that, "You're not all racists.

1002
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,720
That a lot of you are just worried about the

1003
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:32,920
future of this country." And they don't believe me.

1004
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,840
So I need you to prove me right.

1005
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,520
If it's about immigration and it's

1006
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,600
not about racism, keep saying that.

1007
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,480
And if you see racists in your movement,

1008
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,760
you need to do something about that.

1009
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,720
Because these economic problems that we're seeing

1010
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,160
in our country of growing inequality, falling living

1011
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,600
standards, unaffordability of housing, I guarantee you

1012
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,920
right now, they are affecting people on both sides.

1013
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,800
And I guarantee you right now, if you guys are

1014
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,600
not able to aggressively find your common ground

1015
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,160
and unity, that division will tear this country

1016
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,720
apart and will destroy the living standards

1017
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,080
for your futures, your kids and your grandkids.

1018
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,320
So listen, that's my final message.

1019
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,200
I don't like doing this schoolteacher ****.

1020
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,360
I don't know if it's going to work.

1021
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,360
But, if you're divided, you will lose.

1022
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,720
And I'm not saying that just to the

1023
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,120
Right, I'm not saying that just to

1024
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,920
the Left, I'm saying that to everyone.

1025
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,440
If you are divided, you will lose.

1026
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,480
Every single year, the richer get richer.

1027
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,080
Every single year, the rich get richer

1028
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,000
and richer and richer and richer.

1029
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,400
And ordinary people lose their homes.

1030
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,040
And ordinary families can't

1031
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
afford to have kids, you know.

1032
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,280
Can't afford to turn the heating on.

1033
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,120
That is what happens.

1034
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,000
If you're divided, you will lose.

1035
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,040
If you are divided, you will lose.

1036
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,880
You will spend your time fighting each other

1037
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,720
and the rich will take everything.

1038
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,720
You're going to need each other.

1039
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,320
Don't forget that.

1040
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,600
Tax wealth, not work.

1041
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,560
Thank you very much.
