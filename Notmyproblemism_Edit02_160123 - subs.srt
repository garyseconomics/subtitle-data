1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,600
I wanted to do one about this problem I've been encountering.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,480
Which I've been calling, not my problemism.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,800
I've been thinking about this a lot

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,960
since I gave

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,840
a talk a while ago at a fancy advertising agency in London.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
I think somebody dropped out of the panel last minute,

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,400
and they called me up. Can you step in?

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,280
So I went to this kind of, like, fancy advertising event.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,560
It's quite a lot of people there,

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,840
maybe like a few hundred people there. I was talking on a panel.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,080
And I did like

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,000
what I usually do, which is basically say,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,360
listen, the economy is going to go

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,280
absolutely to sh*t, like it's already doing that.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,280
And like if we don't take action to stop it,

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,680
it's going to get worse and worse and worse

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,760
and it's going to be absolutely f**king disaster.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,760
And there was a lady on the panel,

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,880
by all accounts, quite a nice lady.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,640
There's nothing against her personally.

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,040
But she, sort of, came in and said, well, you know, if,

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,680
if it all goes to sh*t like that, I would just,

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,920
I would just move to France, I’d move to Spain,

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
you know, I was like, alright, fine.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,680
And then another guy on the panel

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,120
came in and he said, Well,

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,600
what gives me hope

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,280
is that, you know, if you look at the big picture,

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,480
you can look at the long term, look at nature.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,400
What you see is that things move in cycles.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,120
Things get better and things get worse,

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,320
things go up and things go down.

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,640
I remember thinking, Alright, that's good for you.

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,480
And what I couldn't help

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,440
but feel in this situation is basically, you know,

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,920
you're in this room full of

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
relatively well-paid people

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,120
who are doing pretty well for themselves, telling themselves

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,240
and telling each other, okay, yeah,

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,160
well, worlds going to happen to this sh*t. But

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,800
it's alright because things move in cycles.

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,200
You know what I mean!

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,640
and I felt like, okay.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,400
What I saw here in this space was basically

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
a lot of people,

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,240
they're probably not all very wealthy people,

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,120
but they've got decent, well-paid jobs at the moment

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,400
and they're working hard and

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,880
they want to believe

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,600
that things will get better without their intervention

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,200
because they don't want to have to f**king

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,080
do anything, basically.

53
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,120
And this is what I've been calling, not my problemism.

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
And what you've got here

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,320
in this conversation is basically two kinds of different

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
not my problemism.

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,440
One of which is like,

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
okay, things are going to sh*t but it’s okay because I’ll leave.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
And the other one is okay, things are going to sh*t.

60
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,880
But you know, big picture, things

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,360
move in cycles, it’s out of my control and

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,600
it's understandable, right?

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Like, it's

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,440
not easy

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
to live in a world where things are getting worse

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
as quickly as they are

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
and where it's kind of increasingly obvious

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,840
that things are going to get really, really bad, right?

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,760
And I think personally

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,080
that I have a responsibility

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,160
to try and do something to stop that.

72
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,840
But, you know, as an individual, we don't have a lot of power

73
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,080
and it's much easier to just focus on our own

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
things like trying to get better job, trying to make more money.

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,120
You know,

76
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,440
I've got to renovate my kitchen,

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,200
you know what I mean, I'm

78
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,120
trying to find the new yoga club, or whatever.

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Life is full of little things that we would rather focus on

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,240
than trying to stop this big thing that is out of our control.

81
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,640
And, you

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,920
know, another thing that I hear, especially when I talk to guys

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,000
who I use to work with in banking,

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
and these are pretty rich guys. It's not my job.

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,160
It's the job of the politicians.

86
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,760
It's not my job, it’s the job of the politicians, alright.

87
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,520
The message I want to send is.

88
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,760
I can absolutely guarantee you

89
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,520
the politicians are not going to f**king fix this.

90
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,880
The people whose job

91
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,600
it is to fix this, I guarantee you they're not going to fix it.

92
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,360
You know, I spoken to a lot of them.

93
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,840
These guys, they don't understand it.

94
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,400
They're not going to fix it.

95
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,840
But more than that, they're not f**king getting hurt by it

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,600
from where they're sitting, things look pretty fine.

97
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,240
You know, these well paid advertising execs, these bankers,

98
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
these politicians, you know,

99
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,320
especially top level politicians, you know, Rishi Sunaks,

100
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,280
who have £700 million, you know,

101
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,160
I mean, these sort of politicians,

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
they're not all that wealthy,

103
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
but they become wealthy very quickly.

104
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,880
They're not going to fix it.

105
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,280
I guarantee you they're not going to fix it.

106
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,520
So we live in a world where the people

107
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,240
whose problem it definitely should be,

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,560
top level politicians, top level economists, top level bankers,

109
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,720
100% guarantee they're not going to fix it.

110
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,680
So whose problem is it and whose responsibility is it to fix it?

111
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,720
And this is the reason why

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I stopped doing articles for the Guardian and moved to YouTube.

113
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,480
Because if I wrote articles for The Guardian,

114
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
I could talk to politicians in the Labour Party.

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,920
I could talk to economists at think thanks.

116
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
These guys are not getting it.

117
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,680
They're not going to fix it,

118
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,000
even though it might be their responsibility to fix it.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,160
They're not going to fix it.

120
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,800
The people who are getting hit

121
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,400
are literally the ordinary men and women out there

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,240
doing anything, working as teachers, working

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,600
as hairdressers, working as taxi drivers,

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,240
working as electricians, working in offices.

125
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,280
These regular people are the guys who are going to get hit.

126
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
And if you were to ask them,

127
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,960
whose job is it to prevent this economic disaster,

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,560
they don't think it's their job, right.

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,240
And it shouldn't be their job.

130
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,680
But the people whose job it is to fix this,

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,840
they're not going to fix it.

132
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
They are not going to fix this

133
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,280
because they don't think they're getting hurt by it.

134
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,200
So then this is not a moral question, right?

135
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
Like if my house is burning down

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
and I know the firefighters are not going to come fix it,

137
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,040
but it's my f**king job to get the family out of the house.

138
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,880
You know, so I'm turning around, the reason I moved to YouTube

139
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,000
is because the way I see it,

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,480
I know these guys are not economists,

141
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,080
and I know these guys are not firefighters,

142
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
but these are the guys whose house is burning down.

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,640
So

144
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,680
the way I see it, in a sense, this is not my problemism

145
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,000
is a big, is one of our biggest problems in a sense.

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,360
Because the situation that we have

147
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,720
is a situation in which 70, 80,

148
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
90% of people are going to be really,

149
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
really badly hit in the long term.

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
If it's not you, it's your kids, your grandkids.

151
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,800
I guarantee that. And I don't just say that I'll bet on this.

152
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,680
I bet on this every day,

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,000
and I make a ton of money doing it, right.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
And people who don't believe that can go back

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,160
and look at my predictions from the beginning of COVID, right.

156
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
These guys are not going to fix it for you, right.

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,640
And you are going to get hit.

158
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,000
So you are the one who has to stop it.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,440
And that means we are in a kind of perverse situation

160
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,080
where the responsibility that should be falling on

161
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,640
Oxford economics professors

162
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,720
and should be falling on top level politicians and top level

163
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
journalists is actually falling on

164
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
just regular people on the street

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
and they're not being given the support.

166
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
So there's a couple of messages I would like to send.

167
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,280
One, if you are a wealthy person

168
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,600
and you think it's not your problem,

169
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,320
ask yourself whose problem is, you know,

170
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,600
and ask yourself how you would feel

171
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,640
if it was your family on the line,

172
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,480
because in the long run it will be.

173
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,680
But really, the more important message

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,040
I want to send this to the average people

175
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,120
who are not from the elites of society.

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,680
The message I want to send to them is,

177
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,440
these guys at the top will not protect you,

178
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,720
but you can protect yourselves

179
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,120
by the only power that you have is strength in numbers.

180
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,760
And the only way you use your strength in numbers

181
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,120
is if enough ordinary people abandon Their not my problemism

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,200
and accept that it is our problem communally.

183
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,400
So I mean, this is a difficult thing

184
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,360
to achieve in an individualised society.

185
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,840
But the more I sit and think about this,

186
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,160
the more I realise the only defence ordinary people have

187
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,640
is that there's a lot of them.

188
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,560
And if they continue to act

189
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,280
in ways that are individualised

190
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,720
and refuse to accept that it is their collective problem,

191
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,400
the more power they will lose over time.

192
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,120
So, yeah, I wanted to share this story

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
and again, it's another concerning story, but

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,720
I believe that

195
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
ordinary people have the power to defend themselves,

196
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,360
but only if they come together and only if they understand.

197
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,600
So I'll keep doing what I do.

198
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,680
Explaining to people that the long run

199
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
situation is very bad if we don't act

200
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,840
and hopefully we'll be able to build a movement behind us here

201
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,280
where enough people come together and make things better.

202
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,440
So that's it, thank you.
