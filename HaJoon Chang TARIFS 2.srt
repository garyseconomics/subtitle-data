1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,000
It's like suddenly saying,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,680
okay, I have this 45 year old

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,440
son who's not doing very well,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,880
and I'm going to protect him. Yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,400
We have in the news today.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,320
Today is what is it

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,440
called, freedom Day, Liberation today.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,120
Today is the day that

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,680
today is the day

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,680
that Donald Trump is trying to impose a lot of tariffs.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,360
So I know you talk a lot in your work

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,560
about how poor countries become rich.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,640
It's a really interesting topic

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,200
because really not a lot of poor

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,480
countries have successfully become rich in the last

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,200
70 years.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,160
And Korea

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,680
is probably like

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
one of the outstanding examples of one that has done.

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,720
And correct me if I'm wrong,

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,560
but from my understanding of your work,

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
you speak a lot

23
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,240
about how actually

24
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,640
a lot of the countries which did become rich,

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,400
not just Korea,

26
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,360
but also including the United States in its history

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,880
and the United Kingdom,

28
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,600
use things like tariffs and things like protectionism.

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,040
So I guess I couldn't really have you on today.

30
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,040
I don't know if Trump's tariff day without asking you

31
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,920
what you think about tax as a concept.

32
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,000
What do you think about Trump's tariffs plans.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,120
Where do you think they will

34
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,440
they improve living standards for Americans?

35
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,040
Yeah.

36
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,520
Well,

37
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,080
first of all, tariffs, like all other policy tools,

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
can be used for good, useful, bad purposes, you know.

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
So, you know, there's no tool that is,

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,440
universally, good or universally bad.

41
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,600
Yeah.

42
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
So, it all depends on why are you using it,

43
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
how you are using it. Yeah.

44
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,040
So the most, successful use of, tariff is,

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,120
based on this idea of infant industry protection.

46
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,080
Yeah.

47
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,480
So that idea is, basically that the governments or,

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
economically backward nations

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
need to protect and nurture the industries,

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,480
through tariffs,

51
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,480
but also other means like, subsidies and so on,

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,760
so that they can grow up

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,240
and compete with, superior foreign firms eventually.

54
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,320
But why they develop, they need to be protected

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,760
and, you know, the hint is in the name.

56
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,760
I mean, it's, based on the idea of, child rearing.

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,200
Yeah.

58
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,600
I mean, in the same way that,

59
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,440
you could send your kids, to work at the age of 5 or

60
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,520
6, as.

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
Many people do.

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,200
Yeah.

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,840
And that, today, many, countries are still doing,

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,000
many poor countries

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,520
and that that will, in the short run,

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,760
save you money because,

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
you don't have to, people, the kids, the,

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
education, food,

69
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,200
you know, accommodation and, he will,

70
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,200
support himself, you know, but this will mean that,

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,120
this guy can never become,

72
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,640
I don't know, nuclear physicist.

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,200
Do it. Economy. Economy.

74
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,160
Yeah. That's right.

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,960
God forbid.

76
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,320
Yeah. The architect. Yeah.

77
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,560
He cannot become a high productivity person.

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,240
If he doesn't go to school, go to eventually,

79
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,080
hopefully university. Yeah.

80
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,520
So you need to attack,

81
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,920
send the kid to school until it, kind of grows up.

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,320
Yeah.

83
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,320
And then that, push it into the, other labor market.

84
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah.

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
And, yeah,

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
country after country has,

87
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,720
succeeded with this, scheme and, Britain and

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
indeed the 18th and early 19th century was,

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,480
still not the leading, technological,

90
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,640
nation.

91
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,720
In Europe, because at the time, Belgium,

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
the Netherlands, parts of Italy were ahead of Britain

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
in terms of technology.

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,600
Britain used, protective measures to grow

95
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,680
is domestic industries in the 19th century and until,

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,960
in the Second World War, the US had very high tariffs,

97
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,440
you know, 40, 50%.

98
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,440
So Trump tariff is nothing compared to that,

99
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,880
because that at the time the US was, basically

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
struggling against,

101
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,720
British and other European competition. Yeah.

102
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,160
And this is idea, which was actually formalized,

103
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,480
by the first finance minister called the

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
they call it,

105
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,920
Treasury secretary in the country

106
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,960
of the United States

107
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,000
of America,

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Alexander Hamilton, the guy on the $10 bill,

109
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,920
the guy who's, life has been made into a hip

110
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,040
hop musical. Yeah.

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
So that, this idea has, enabled,

112
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,400
many nations, later, Germany, Sweden,

113
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,800
France, that,

114
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Japan, Korea, Taiwan all use this idea to develop.

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,760
This particular. Exact.

116
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,960
Young industries.

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,800
Well, what Trump is doing is it's not that exactly.

118
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
So it's, like, that, something is saying,

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,800
okay, I have this that, 45 year old

121
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,560
son was not doing very well.

122
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
And I'm going to protect him.

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

124
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,960
This is that that, nonsensical.

125
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah, yeah.

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Also,

127
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,920
you know, he seems to think that, by using tariff,

128
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,880
you can, make other, countries,

129
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,640
come and invest in the US.

130
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,360
And, I mean, yeah, it's sad

131
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,400
that something that has happened

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
many, many times in the past,

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,640
many developing countries put up high tide before, but,

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,840
kind of, that, was, partly

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,680
to encourage the domestic producers, but also that,

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
to motivate,

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,040
foreign companies to come and set up, factories.

138
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
So, for example, Brazil had a very high protection

139
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,280
against 14 car imports there in the 1960s and 70s.

140
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,040
So fiat for

141
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,800
these guys, came and, built cars in Brazil.

142
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,560
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
So that, that this is known as, tariff jumping.

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,280
So that Trump's hope is that, if I set up this tariff

145
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,000
wall, Korean companies, Japanese companies,

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,120
German companies are going to come and produce

147
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,240
their electric cars and semiconductors.

148
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,080
It. Yeah, some of it is going to happen.

149
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,320
But the trouble is that,

150
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,320
this is, not going to be one year.

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,760
You know, if,

152
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,760
for, Well, was this making America great?

153
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,520
And of course, it will raise the cost, so.

155
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,880
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,880
first of all, you cannot

157
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,280
kind of rebuild, this, industries

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,680
by simply having one factory here, one factory

159
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
there because, you know, in order to have, really,

160
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,800
high productivity, you need,

161
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,680
not just the factory making the final product, but,

162
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,000
a whole kind of, industrial ecosystem as,

163
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,080
some economists call it.

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
So you need the, workers with the right skills

165
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
infrastructure that is, suited to the industry,

166
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,360
even university, departments, doing

167
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,920
research in the area that you are, specializing in.

168
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,960
So on this,

169
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,400
you have this, that tissue, but, support system.

170
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,080
Yeah. You are not going to achieve high productivity.

171
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,560
Yeah.

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,720
But secondly, that the most,

173
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,080
something that most people don't even realize

174
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,160
is that the US financial system

175
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
is now so parasitic

176
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,920
that, is not going to that,

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
Allow that, Mr.

178
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
Trump's plan to work

179
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,480
because,

180
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
you know, the idea is that when you give protection,

181
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,160
your domestic companies will not only have, protection

182
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,680
from foreign competition,

183
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,960
but they also have extra resources, you know,

184
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,400
because that that, they can charge, more.

185
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,280
Yeah.

186
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,000
And the hope is that they'll use that resource

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,360
to invest in raising productivity,

188
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,400
which is what happened in Japan. Korea.

189
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,920
Yeah.

190
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Now, the US, financial system.

191
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,800
Is actually going to drain this extra resource

192
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
from these companies. Yeah.

193
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,640
And to make that, income inequality even worse.

194
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,200
Yeah. Yeah.

195
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,480
So yeah, because, in the last 25 years,

196
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,080
the American, the top American corporations

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,120
have, given away something like 90

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,360
to 95% of their profits, to shareholders.

199
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,280
Yeah, through dividends and more importantly,

200
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,160
stock buybacks. Yeah, yeah.

201
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,040
So you can buy extra resources to these companies.

202
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,240
Are they going to invest. No.

203
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,200
Their shareholders will say to more stock buybacks.

204
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,680
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,080
We want

206
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,720
you think it's going to lead to higher inequality.

207
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,600
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

208
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,400
On top of that

209
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,120
you will have but until you kind of build

210
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,360
at least some, additional industrial base,

211
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,920
you're going to have serious inflation problem.

212
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,200
I think it's.

214
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,800
Just, this is a politically unsustainable.

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,720
It's going to be it's

216
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,000
going to make life harder for poor people.

217
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,920
Yeah. Exactly.

218
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,080
Yeah.

219
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
So I think, increasing inequality.

220
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah.

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
And, you know, seriously,

222
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
I mean, you cannot rebuild,

223
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,240
an industrial base that had been eroded

224
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
for the last 40 years within 2 or 3 years. Yeah.

225
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
Yeah, it will take at least, a couple of decades.

226
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,440
Yeah.

227
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,400
And this is very, very broad

228
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,120
tariff on almost everything. Exactly. Yeah.

229
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,760
Let's try it. Yeah.

230
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,720
It seems unwise.

231
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:15,880
Yeah.

232
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,720
If, tariffs are going to work, it has to be targeted.

233
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,440
Yeah.

234
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
Do you want to develop automobile industry?

235
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,400
Yes. Protect automobile industry.

236
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,160
But then and then you.

237
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,560
Can make sure you have the workers.

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Exactly. Yeah. You have.

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

240
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,200
There's no plan like that. Yeah. So.

241
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,240
So we don't think we're going

242
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,520
to see an improvement in living standards.

243
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,760
No no no. No neither do I.

244
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,200
Yeah. It's hopefully won't be that bad, but, Yeah.

245
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Pessimistic.

246
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
Yeah, I'm very pessimistic.

247
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,920
But, you know,

248
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,600
one good thing about that

249
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Trump is that he has no ideology.

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,480
If it doesn't work, he will change his mind that,

251
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,040
Yeah,

252
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,920
I do want well,

253
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,680
I said this on the channel

254
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
before,

255
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,760
it's very hard to guess from what Trump says,

256
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,600
what Trump actually is going to do.

257
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,960
That's it.

258
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,320
So, we we hope he'll go back on this

259
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
because I think it would be bad

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,960
for everyone, including Americans, I suspect.

261
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,480
Yeah. Yeah.
