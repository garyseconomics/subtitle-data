1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,280
Today we are going to talk

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,520
about how you keep your house.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:08,880
Okay.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,720
So I wanted to do a video called

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,360
How You Keep Your House.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,120
Because the whole argument of this channel

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,880
is that we live in an economy of rapidly

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,280
growing wealth inequality.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,280
And that leads to ordinary families

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,080
losing their homes, governments losing their assets,

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,800
and ordinary families and governments

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,760
going further and further into debt,

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,160
because those assets are going to the rich

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,120
and people are being forced to basically borrow money

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,080
back from the rich in order

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,880
to protect any asset ownership.

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,360
And, this is really, really bad

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
specifically for the middle class, right.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,840
Because the middle class

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,200
are the group of people in society

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
who used to own assets and are losing their assets.

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
But as the

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,040
middle class

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,360
lose their assets to the rich and the rich

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,720
get richer

27
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,000
and richer and richer,

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
because rich people like to buy assets,

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,320
as the rich get richer,

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
they bid the prices of assets up

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,200
and you get this kind of split,

32
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
which is rich people like assets,

33
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,080
ordinary people like goods and services.

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,480
So as inequality increases,

35
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,920
asset prices go up and wage,

36
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,080
wage rates fall.

37
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,680
And the middle class should hate this, right?

38
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,280
Because they're the group of people

39
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,480
that own the assets.

40
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,880
And yet sometimes when I talk to my more

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,160
middle class friends, they,

42
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,320
they actually think it's good because what they see is

43
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,760
their house price is rising, stock prices are rising.

44
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:32,920
You know,

45
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,600
maybe they've got like a small like pension pot

46
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,680
and that's going up.

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,320
So for them it's kind of like the number’s

48
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,120
going up, we’re good, I'm getting richer.

49
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,760
My house price is going up.

50
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,040
My pension pot is going up.

51
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,040
So it creates this kind of like interesting,

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,440
confusing thing which is happening,

53
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,520
which is the same group of people in society

54
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,040
who are getting squeezed out,

55
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,320
are kind of like cheering on their own demise,

56
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,800
and they think they're winning because they say, well,

57
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm getting richer.

58
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,680
And what I normally say to these people is, well,

59
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
you know, the only way for you

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,440
to benefit from your house price going up

61
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,960
is to sell your house.

62
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,040
And once you've sold your house,

63
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,440
you know, in a world where housing is

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,760
unbelievably expensive,

65
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,800
then your kids will never get homes.

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
So you're basically,

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,600
you know, you're selling the family's silverware,

68
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
you're going to become poor.

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,840
And the only way for you to benefit

70
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,600
is to give up the most important thing

71
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,080
that you have, basically.

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,320
And what they then sometimes say to me is,

73
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,960
well it doesn't matter, I'm

74
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,040
just not going to sell the house.

75
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm not going to sell the house, I'm going to dig in.

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm going to keep the house.

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
And you have this kind of perception of,

78
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm just going to hold onto this thing.

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm going to cling on to this asset

80
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,240
and I'm going to get richer, I'm

81
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
going to get richer, I'm going to get richer.

82
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,440
And they’re kind of seduced in a way,

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,680
by like this rising asset value.

84
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,920
So I wanted to do this video today

85
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
to talk about this idea of, I can keep my house

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,080
as long as I just never sell,

87
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,640
and kind of explain why

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,320
that is basically a bad strategy

89
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,680
to take care of your family

90
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,520
in the world that we live in.

91
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,040
And the reason for that is

92
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,680
so if you accept that we live in this world

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,160
where inequality is increasing,

94
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,880
and in general

95
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,800
the middle class is being thinned out

96
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,040
and the government is becoming poorer,

97
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,880
and that wealth is instead being held by the rich.

98
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
That causes a thing to happen,

99
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,320
which is asset

100
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
prices get more and more and more expensive,

101
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
and the rich hold more

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
and more and more and more assets.

103
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
But because the middle class,

104
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,720
which is your traditional consumer, is being weakened,

105
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,800
the cost of like basic consumption doesn't really go up

106
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
because that basic consumption

107
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,200
market is selling to ordinary people.

108
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,680
Ordinary people are being screwed over.

109
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
It's the rich who are making money,

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
and what they want is assets.

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,920
So then from the perspective of an individual

112
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,160
rich person, what you have is, I'm crazy, crazy rich.

113
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
I have a ton of assets.

114
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,800
The price of those assets is going through the roof.

115
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,960
And yet the cost of regular consumption

116
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,680
is really, really low.

117
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,640
And I often talk about on this channel

118
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,080
that rich people have like a low

119
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,600
marginal propensity to consume,

120
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,240
which is they don't tend to spend a lot of the money

121
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,160
you give them.

122
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,400
But as they get richer and richer and richer and richer

123
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
and the price of assets get more

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,960
and more expensive relative

125
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,200
to the price of consumption,

126
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,320
these guys will start to consume more stuff.

127
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
And that is when

128
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,080
this kind of, I'm going to keep my house,

129
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm not going to sell my house person,

130
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,440
basically starts to get screwed.

131
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
And I think, I think probably the easiest way...

132
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,760
easiest place in which you can see it at the moment

133
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,360
is, for example, in elite education.

134
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,840
So very rich people,

135
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
they want to send their kids to elite universities,

136
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,120
Oxford, Cambridge, you know, Harvard, Yale.

137
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,000
And there's only so many places at these like top,

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,760
top universities

139
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,800
which you kind of need to get into nowadays

140
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,760
if you want to get one of the best paid jobs

141
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
and as the rich get richer and richer and richer,

142
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,000
it becomes quite easy for them to pay $30,000, $50,000.

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
And, you know,

144
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,560
rich people do frequently pay

145
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,720
those kinds of amounts of money per year

146
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,600
to send their kids to elite universities.

147
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
And they can do that.

148
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
They can easily do that

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,160
because they're super, super, super, super rich.

150
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,120
And it is only because in some parts of the world,

151
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,960
the government protects ordinary people,

152
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,680
that ordinary people don't have to do that.

153
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,360
But as the universities can increasingly sell

154
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,160
a place to a rich person for 50,000 70,000 a year,

155
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,280
inevitably that starts to squeeze up the price

156
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
that you have to pay

157
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,680
to send your kids to an elite university.

158
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,440
And that is when you start

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
to see the consequences of your strategy,

160
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
which is I'm going to hold onto my house

161
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,840
and I'm not going to care about the fact

162
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,720
that the 1% is getting unbelievably rich.

163
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,000
That's like politics of envy. Forget that.

164
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Well,

165
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
your kids are competing with their kids

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
to go to the elite universities,

167
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
and if their wealth is just blowing up,

168
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,040
then they're going to pay 50 grand a year,

169
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,200
70 grand a year, 90 grand a year.

170
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,440
And eventually the end result is, your kids

171
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,160
can’t afford to go to a good university,

172
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,200
they can't compete with their kids for the best jobs,

173
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,520
and then their kids are making £500,000 a year,

174
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,040
and your kids are, you know,

175
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,080
working for £20,000, £30,000, £40,000 a year.

176
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,640
So it ends up in a situation where, okay,

177
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,160
I hold onto my house, but the cost of that would be

178
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,960
my kids can't go to a good university,

179
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,800
my kids can't get a good job.

180
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,600
But it's not just the elite university market, right?

181
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
So I went to a grammar school

182
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,560
in East London,

183
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,400
so for people who don't know, a

184
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,560
grammar school is like

185
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,840
a free school, but it's like a slightly fancy school

186
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,960
and it tends to get people into better

187
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,680
jobs, better universities.

188
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,760
So I went to school with a lot of kind of middle

189
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,040
class kids who got good degrees

190
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,240
and a lot of them went into medicine and dentistry.

191
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,160
So they became doctors and dentists.

192
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,280
And now

193
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
the doctors and dentists who make the most money,

194
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,320
what they do is

195
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,520
cosmetic surgery

196
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,600
for rich people,

197
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,120
things like Botox or like teeth whitening,

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,640
teeth straightening,

199
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,600
cosmetic stuff

200
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,560
that is obviously not like medically essential.

201
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
Or they work for private

202
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,240
healthcare, healthcare for rich people.

203
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
And, you know, that's who cares about that.

204
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,200
That's politics of envy.

205
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,240
Well, what happens when you need a dentist?

206
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
What happens when your kids need a dentist?

207
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
And we're in a situation now in this country

208
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,600
where it's becoming increasingly impossible

209
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
to get a NHS dentists

210
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,880
to get cheaper, affordable dental care.

211
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,840
And as a result,

212
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,120
people are just not going to the dentist.

213
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
And it's not that the dentists are not there.

214
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,320
It is that

215
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
just like your kids are in competition

216
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
with the kids of the rich for elite

217
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,680
university places,

218
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,440
you and your kids are in competition

219
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
with the rich for access to the dentists

220
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
and access to the doctors.

221
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,120
So you're there.

222
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,360
You're thinking, I'm going to keep my house.

223
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,160
I'm going to keep my house.

224
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to keep my house.

225
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Who cares if they're getting rich?

226
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,600
That's politics of envy, that's politics of envy.

227
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,760
And then they've out competed for university.

228
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,280
Your kids can't go to university.

229
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,520
They've out competed for a dentist.

230
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,200
Now kids don’t have a dentist.

231
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,720
They've outcompeted you for the doctors.

232
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,320
And now you can't get access to healthcare.

233
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,680
What I'm trying to say is, it's a very unwise strategy

234
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,040
to hold onto your house like it's your baby

235
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,440
and just watch the price of the house going up

236
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,640
while you and your class are being rapidly outcompeted

237
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,840
for all of the things that you need

238
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,960
by this one other group of society.

239
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Because of course,

240
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
nobody can force you to sell your house, but they can

241
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,320
take all of the other things that you need

242
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,680
and eventually are going to be put in a situation

243
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,600
where the only way to get a basic,

244
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,560
just the basics of living is to sell, sell your house.

245
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
And the most obvious example of

246
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,040
this is when you look at equity releases schemes.

247
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,880
So the people who don't know

248
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,920
what equity release schemes are,

249
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,560
you'll see these advertised.

250
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,720
If you’re ever watching daytime TV,

251
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,400
you'll see them advertised on TV.

252
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,000
And my grandparents all owned property,

253
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,360
but they never died with property

254
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,320
because they used these equity release schemes.

255
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,280
And these equity release

256
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,840
schemes are basically saying, look,

257
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,520
we'll let you keep your house.

258
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,320
You can live in a house till you die,

259
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,960
but we'll give you money during your retirement.

260
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
And then when you die, the house is ours.

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,400
And what you're seeing here is...

262
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,680
I think that the best example is during Covid.

263
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,240
I've spoken about this a lot on the channel.

264
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,880
We gave an enormous amount of money out,

265
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,000
and that money ended up with richer people.

266
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,160
And a lot of people were like,

267
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
well it doesn’t matter if the rich get money.

268
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,520
You know, who cares if the rich get money?

269
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,240
I think there's a quote by Peter Mandelson

270
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,520
who says, I'm intensely relaxed

271
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,560
about the rich getting rich.

272
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
If the rich get rich,

273
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
they will start to consume more stuff,

274
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,960
and some of that stuff will be stuff that you need

275
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,160
and some of the obvious repercussions

276
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,120
of that were, you know,

277
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,080
rents in London went absolutely crazy.

278
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
If you give a tonne of money to rich people,

279
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,600
of course, rents in London will go crazy.

280
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
They'll give that money to their kids.

281
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
The kids will buy houses.

282
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,520
The kids

283
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,560
won’t need to share, they won’t need to take flatmates

284
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,120
because they'll be really, really rich.

285
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,000
There's less housing and the rents will go up.

286
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,440
You know, the rents don't go up out of nowhere.

287
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
Somebody is paying them.

288
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
The rich people are paying them.

289
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,800
So you see them, they squeeze you out of,

290
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,120
they squeeze you out of education,

291
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,000
they squeeze of healthcare, the squeeze out of housing.

292
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,720
You know,

293
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
we were talking earlier today about

294
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
the potato famine in Ireland,

295
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,960
and there were also famines in India

296
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
during British rule.

297
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,080
And at the time that there were famines in India

298
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,600
and millions of people were dying

299
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,400
because of lack of access to food.

300
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,320
There were enormous

301
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,840
fields, farms in India growing tea,

302
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,920
which was shipped to England.

303
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,080
So farms that could be going

304
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,640
food, are growing tea,

305
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,000
an inedible luxury crop to be sent to England

306
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,640
while people, local people, are starving,

307
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
dying, you know.

308
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,840
It doesn't matter if you keep your house

309
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,320
because eventually the rich are going to outcompete you

310
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,560
for education, for health care, for housing.

311
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
And at the end of the day, for food and energy.

312
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,760
And know when we talk about these

313
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,240
old ladies who are using equity release schemes,

314
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,680
you know, in

315
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,560
many cases,

316
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,360
these are old ladies

317
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,240
who are using those equity release schemes

318
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,320
to heat their homes while they're 80 years old.

319
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,760
And, you know,

320
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,880
why is it that the energy price has doubled?

321
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,840
You know, who's using the energy?

322
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,360
Rich people. Rich people don't keep the heating off.

323
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,360
You know, if you allow these people

324
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,520
to get richer and richer and richer,

325
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,880
they will consume more.

326
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,320
You will consume less.

327
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,160
And eventually you'll be forced to sell your house.

328
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
It doesn't work.

329
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,120
So I guess the point I'm trying to make here is

330
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,520
it's very shortsighted

331
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,920
to think that you are winning

332
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
when house prices go up

333
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
just because you are keeping your house,

334
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
when everyone around you,

335
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
your class, people like you, people

336
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,520
in the same financial situation

337
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,360
as you, are losing their houses

338
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,560
and a small section of society that you are not in

339
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,240
is taking everything.

340
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,560
You know,

341
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
the wealth of the rich will grow and grow and grow.

342
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
If you don't stop that, eventually you lose everything.

343
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
You know, it's a little bit like,

344
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,720
you know, if you play chess,

345
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,520
you only lose a game of chess, if you lose your king.

346
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,680
So if we're playing chess

347
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,320
and you're taking one of my pieces

348
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
every single day

349
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,680
and I'm just like, well, that's not my king.

350
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,760
That's not my king, that's not my king.

351
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,600
You know,

352
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,800
you need to protect your competitive position.

353
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,600
You need to protect your competitive position.

354
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
There's this French film

355
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,000
La haine, talks about a man who jumps off a skyscraper.

356
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
And as he was falling,

357
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,480
keeps saying to himself, so far, so good.

358
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
So far, so good.

359
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,760
So far, so good.

360
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,440
Yes, I know house prices are going up

361
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,720
and house prices are going up

362
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,240
because the rich are getting richer

363
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840
and richer and richer.

364
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,400
That is not...

365
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,280
an increase in wealth

366
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,800
inequality is not an abstract thing.

367
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,360
It is a transfer of wealth

368
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,520
away from the middle class,

369
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,720
which most of the viewers will be in

370
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
towards the super rich.

371
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,560
It looks good because your house is going up.

372
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,240
The end result is

373
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,520
the only way you can keep

374
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
that house is by slowly

375
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,360
giving up every single one of the things that you need,

376
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,600
and that guarantees poverty, basically.

377
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,480
So the end of the video, how to keep your house.

378
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,600
The way to keep your house,

379
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
if you are a middle class person,

380
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
is to protect the middle class

381
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,360
from the rapidly growing wealth of the rich.

382
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,320
You have to stop that flow.

383
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,040
You have to stop that flow like you can't sit there.

384
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,840
You know, it's like you, you know,

385
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,800
you're like one part of the bathwater

386
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,480
watching the bathwater go down the drain.

387
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
You're like, well, my part's not down the drain yet.

388
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,400
You can't, if there is a...

389
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,560
if you exist in a society

390
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,360
where there is an aggressive

391
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,440
flow of wealth

392
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,640
away from the middle class

393
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,960
towards the rich, and you are in the middle class,

394
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,840
you have to stop the flow.

395
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,560
You have to stop the flow.

396
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,840
And I think there's a really like kind of

397
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,400
beautiful parallel in this

398
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,000
where you have,

399
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
we have a new government in the country,

400
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,120
a Labour government,

401
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,600
that is watching wealth like flood

402
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,440
out of the government towards the rich.

403
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,600
And they're just like, well,

404
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,880
if we a little bit more sensible,

405
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
if you manage just a little bit better,

406
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,920
then we can fix things.

407
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,840
And then it turns out

408
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,320
they actually don't have any money to do anything.

409
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,760
What the government are doing

410
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,320
is exactly the same as a middle class person.

411
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,960
It's like,

412
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,480
you're existing in a situation,

413
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,840
you're obviously losing,

414
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,040
you're obviously dying,

415
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,360
your wealth is flooding away, and you are

416
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,920
stupidly, stubbornly resistant

417
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,600
to doing anything to stop that flow.

418
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,800
And then you're surprised when it leads you to poverty.

419
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,440
The way to keep your house

420
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,040
is to protect your class as a group.

421
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,680
If your class dies, if your group dies,

422
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,760
you die as well.

423
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,000
You need to fight back against that.

424
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,560
You need to protect the middle class from the rich.

425
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,280
If you don't do that, the rich eat the middle class,

426
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,560
then there's no middle class.

427
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,600
And if you want to know what a country looks like

428
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,800
with no middle class, go to Mexico.

429
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,560
Go to Colombia, go to Nigeria,

430
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,680
go to India, go to South Africa.

431
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,280
It's poverty for the many.

432
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
The only way to stop that

433
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,920
tax the super rich, lower tax on ordinary people.

434
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,160
You have to fight back.

435
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,480
You have to protect yourself.

436
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,640
Otherwise you lose everything.

437
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,120
You keep your house

438
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,840
by working together and protecting your people.
