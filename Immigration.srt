1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,280
So I've been wanting to do a

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,440
video about immigration for ages.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,960
There's two subjects

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,440
that I've wanted to do videos about,

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,120
for ages that I've not done, which is one immigration

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,640
and two inheritance.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,280
And, I've avoided doing them

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,320
because they are such contentious issues

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,440
and they're so serious.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,280
And I feel like if you do them, you better do them

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,600
f**king well, basically. And,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,280
I really want to do a video on immigration

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,000
because I see it becoming like a

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,240
bigger and bigger and bigger issue.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,440
But I feel like it's such an important video

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,320
that I don't f**k it up, basically.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,960
And I feel like

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,800
because I'm tired,

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,120
I just feel like I don't have the energy to do it,

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,760
like the justice that it deserves.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,160
But obviously we've got the election coming up now.

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
We're talking about, you know,

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,280
we did our election video, right?

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,600
We put it out, like, I guess maybe a week or two ago.

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
And, we didn't talk about the rise of Reform.

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,840
Another thing

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,080
we didn't really talk about is the fact that

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,960
the Conservatives

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,080
could possibly get pumped so hard in this election

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,200
that they drop down into third or fourth place.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,960
They probably wont.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,320
But it's definitely possible.

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,280
And,

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,040
you know, of course, we have this two party system

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,680
which makes it, like almost impossible

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,240
to, like, replace the top two parties.

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,920
And the top two parties have been the top tea parties

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,960
for like a hundred years,

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,240
where like Labour replace the Liberals or whatever.

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,080
And to be honest, I think it's a stupid system.

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,360
I think proportional representation is a better system.

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,080
I think when you have this two party system,

43
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,000
like what we've got now,

44
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,200
you can get this kind of stupid situation

45
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,680
where both the parties are basically complete

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,840
shit and like, you got no choice but to vote for them.

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,200
But also it's undemocratic really,

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,600
because all of the power is within the parties,

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
you know, like you only have two choices.

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
You know,

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,040
they’re kind of similar really like all of the...

52
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,840
The power is not really within the people.

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,760
You know, look at Rishi Sunak like,

54
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,640
you know, people voted in Boris Johnson.

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,880
They kicked him out.

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,120
The party members voted in Theresa May.

57
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,000
They kicked her.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,720
So not Theresa May. Liz Truss, they kicked her out.

59
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,640
And then the MPs, in some ways,

60
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,800
here’s Rishi Sunak, he's the guy we want.

61
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,720
You know, it's really undemocratic, right? But,

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,520
so I guess there's something kind of sexy

63
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
and kind of something exciting about, well,

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,800
we can actually kick out

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
one of these two major parties.

66
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,640
And, you know, I get excited about that.

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
You know, I think that,

68
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
to be completely honest,

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,080
I think the conservatives are basically

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
totally bought by the very rich.

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,240
And I just think, like

72
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,280
our campaign

73
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
to reduce inequality,

74
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
I don't think we're gonna get anything under them.

75
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,040
Don't get me wrong, like,

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
we need to be willing to be flexible.

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,840
And if the conservative

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,520
became of

79
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,480
like a, like a meaningful vehicle for it,

80
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,720
you have to use what you can buy like

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,680
you can't see happening right.

82
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,880
So it's exciting to see them getting like, smashed,

83
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,480
but then like

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
when you see

85
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
the growing sense

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,640
that we see it in the YouTube comments,

87
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
which is the problem is immigration.

88
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,720
The problem is immigration, the problem is immigration.

89
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
You see Nigel Farage

90
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
coming back, the growth of the Reform Party.

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
It’s hard to even be excited

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,840
about the conservatives being smashed,

93
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,720
because if that happens,

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,440
they might get replaced by Reform.

95
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Nigel Farage might take over the Conservative Party,

96
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,920
and it's just really hard to see

97
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,280
to see anything

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
happening other than

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,240
a new right wing alternative coming up that is more

100
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,440
anti immigration.

101
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,520
That is more xenophobic

102
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,960
that could over time

103
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,880
potentially become more racist, right.

104
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,920
So it's hard for me to even be excited

105
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,320
about something

106
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
that I would have liked to be excited about,

107
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
which is the demise of the Conservative Party.

108
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,000
So let's just

109
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640
talk about this immigration thing.

110
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,320
I haven't got, like, a prepped video, right.

111
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,920
The reason I struggle to talk about it

112
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,080
is because I know

113
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
first things first, right,

114
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,480
The target audience for this channel,

115
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,840
nobody's excluded from this channel.

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,600
But this channel, for me,

117
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,160
is about connecting

118
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,920
with just ordinary people,

119
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,840
ordinary people who feel like they

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
are not being spoken to by economists on the news.

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
They don't understand what those guys are saying.

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
They're not being represented, that

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
nobody's on their side, nobody's.

124
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
That's all I want, you know.

125
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
So, you know, you're talking about, you know,

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,640
basically people who might not have like,

127
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,080
you know,

128
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,280
a degree in economics from Cambridge or whatever.

129
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,600
But of course, you know,

130
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,320
it's also a campaign

131
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,200
to raise tax on the very rich,

132
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,880
to reduce inequality, to improve living standards.

133
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,880
And for that reason, we've always had

134
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,360
lot of support

135
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
from the political left

136
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,360
and the people who like first sort of help, you know,

137
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,840
you know, one of the first people who ever, like,

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
helped me, like, grow my profile was,

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
you know, Grace Blakeley, you know,

140
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
who's an economist on the political left.

141
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
And of course, like

142
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
a lot of our early growth came from Novara,

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,480
which is like a big political left channel

144
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,400
So even though I don't see myself

145
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,720
as talking to the political left,

146
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,320
like we've had a lot of support

147
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,760
from the political left, right, and

148
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,920
a lot of the media

149
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,720
and people like Nigel Farage

150
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,640
and of course, people like,

151
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,680
increasingly people in the Conservative Party.

152
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,720
They use immigration as a wedge issue. Right.

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
So we should explain what a wedge issue is, right?

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
A wedge issue

155
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,160
is when a political group sees

156
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,480
an issue which divides their opponents

157
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,400
from the general public.

158
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
And the conservatives know

159
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,800
that a lot of the political left

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
hates anything that's anti-immigration.

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,920
But they know that a lot of ordinary people

162
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,640
think immigration is too high.

163
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
In particular,

164
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,480
a lot of ordinary

165
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,560
people think that the reason why they can't get a house

166
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,480
and the reason why they can't get a well-paid job

167
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,000
is because of immigration.

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,480
And you can understand why they think that, right?

169
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,720
There was a piece on the news, Sky news.

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
So like totally mainstream

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,360
news the other day, Sky news,

172
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,720
housing crisis and immigration.

173
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
And it's a really simple narrative to make.

174
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Which is these guys are coming over,

175
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,600
they live in houses.

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,120
You need houses. They compete with you for houses.

177
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
They compete with you for jobs.

178
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,760
They're bringing your wages down.

179
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,560
They're pushing house prices up, right.

180
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,520
So ordinary people who are

181
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,240
struggling are being told these things.

182
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,920
You can understand why they become

183
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
anti-immigration, right?

184
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,160
Because life is getting hard for most,

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
you know, for most people,

186
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,720
the most obvious thing is getting a house

187
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,440
or getting a job.

188
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,480
These are like some of the most obvious problems.

189
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,200
And they're being told, the reason you can't do

190
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,680
that is because of immigration, right?

191
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,600
I don't personally think the primary reason

192
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,440
why life is getting harder

193
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,040
is because of immigration, right?

194
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,720
I think the primary reason that life is getting hired

195
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
is because of this growing inequality.

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
But this is what people are being told,

197
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,720
people are being told it's immigration and it's...

198
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,760
My voice is a lot less loud

199
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,960
than these other voices, right?

200
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,320
These are the voices, like pushing against immigration.

201
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,960
And, the truth of the matter is,

202
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I don't know how to stop it.

203
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
I don't know how to stop

204
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,240
ordinary people who are being told the reason that they

205
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,080
can't afford the house,

206
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,040
the reason they can't get a good job

207
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,520
is because of foreigners.

208
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,640
I don't know how to stop them from believing that.

209
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,360
And I'm very, very confident that

210
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,760
the economic situation will get worse

211
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,560
because the inequality will get worse.

212
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,920
And, you know, we're going to get a Labour government

213
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
that is not going to deal with the inequality.

214
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,440
They're not going to successfully

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,400
stop the fall in living standards.

216
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,880
And people are gonna want something new, right?

217
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,560
Like,

218
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,000
you can see the Conservative Party has basically lost

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
almost completely economic

220
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,560
credibility at this point, right.

221
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,640
So we've got a Labour government, okay.

222
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,520
You're second in charge.

223
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,840
What are you going to do?

224
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
They’re not going to fix it, right.

225
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
They're not going to fix it.

226
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,680
So then people are going to be like, all right,

227
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,840
who's next? And it's really, really obvious who's next.

228
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,760
It's really obvious who is next in line,

229
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,080
it is Nigel Farage and is the...

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
it is reduce immigration, it is stop immigration.

231
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,040
And I don't think that

232
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,880
those guys will win.

233
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,880
But you can see them taking over,

234
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,120
you can see them taking over.

235
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,640
And I don't f**king know what to do it, basically.

236
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,760
I don't know what to do about it.

237
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,040
And you can see it divides, the sort of,

238
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,320
ordinary people from the political left, and you can...

239
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,360
you know, I can see that the political left is...

240
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,600
a lot of it is going to try and hang

241
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,120
to, like, no,

242
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,920
whatever they don't, they're going to

243
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,480
consider that they have a

244
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,200
like a moral need to protect the immigrants, right.

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
And then that's going to divide them more.

246
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,760
And then the left are going to die, right.

247
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,160
And then

248
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,200
the right is going to come in

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,040
and they're going to try to reduce immigration,

250
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,960
but that's not actually going

251
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,320
to fix the living standards problem,

252
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,880
because it's not the actual cause of the problem.

253
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,680
So they're going to say, well, we need to go further,

254
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,960
you know what I mean?

255
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,880
And it's really hard for me

256
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
not to be reminded of what happened

257
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,560
in the early 20th century.

258
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
And, you know,

259
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
people in the comments, you’re

260
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
not talking about immigrants,

261
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,960
you're not talking about immigrants...

262
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,040
I don't know what to say to them,

263
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,160
you know, what do I say to them?

264
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,840
You know, because I don't think that is the problem.

265
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
But then you see people on the political left,

266
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
and I think often

267
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,040
sometimes the political left

268
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,200
has a kind of a condescending,

269
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,760
sneering attitude towards these people.

270
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,360
And

271
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,920
these people

272
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,960
are struggling to pay the bills

273
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,600
and they're being told it's

274
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,240
because the immigrants, you know, I mean.

275
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,960
We need to offer them something.

276
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,360
You know, we need to offer them an alternative.

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,760
And I've been trying to build

278
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,760
like a political coalition on the left of like,

279
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,240
let's make inequality the big thing.

280
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,280
Let's make inequality the big thing.

281
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,360
And I've been failing.

282
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,000
It's f**king hard, basically.

283
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
But,

284
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,320
I think we’ll put this one out after the election one.

285
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,480
And, I just want to say, like,

286
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
to the people who think it's

287
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,200
because of the immigrants, like,

288
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,720
I understand why you’re saying that

289
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,480
and I understand that life is hard, but, you know,

290
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,640
I just...

291
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,240
I don't think that's the cause,

292
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
you know, I don't think that's the cause.

293
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
And that doesn't mean

294
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,640
I think we should have more immigration.

295
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,160
And it doesn't mean

296
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't think that we should have less immigration.

297
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,080
I think this...

298
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,240
listen, I want to tax rich people, right.

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,160
The rich are getting richer

300
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,760
and richer and richer and richer.

301
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
Ordinary living standards are collapsing.

302
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,400
I want to tax rich people. The rich don't want that.

303
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
And you

304
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,720
can see

305
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
living standards collapsing and you want something.

306
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
They have to offer you something, right?

307
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
They're offering you, let's kick out the immigrants

308
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
and they're going to offer that more and more.

309
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
And it's,

310
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,600
this has happened again and again

311
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
throughout history, right?

312
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,040
It's happened again and again

313
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,360
throughout history that inequality rises,

314
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,000
living standards fall

315
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,960
and the rich,

316
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,320
the easiest thing for them to do

317
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,200
is to sell you a scapegoat.

318
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,280
They can sell you a scapegoat,

319
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,320
and then they can use that to divide the working class.

320
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,560
And you know, I'm talking to you here from Britain.

321
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,920
The working class is very multiracial.

322
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,040
My grandma was an immigrant.

323
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,760
You know what I mean? Like.

324
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
This

325
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,360
could be used to very effectively

326
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,200
divide the working class and make them hate each other.

327
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,480
And if that happens, we're f**ked.

328
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,120
We're totally f**ked. And

329
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
I don't know how to stop it.

330
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Yeah, I don't know how to stop it.

331
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,520
All I can do is keep saying what the real cause is

332
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,000
and keep offering my alternative. And,

333
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,840
I think if you manage to reduce inequality,

334
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,000
if you redistribute away from the very rich towards

335
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,840
working people, cut working people's taxes,

336
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,800
we can have much higher levels of living standards.

337
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,520
Ordinary people can afford their own homes

338
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,840
like my dad did,

339
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,600
like my friends dads did,

340
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
who were themselves immigrants

341
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,560
and came over with nothing.

342
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,880
I think the problem is inequality.

343
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,360
And, I'm honestly, I'm really worried.

344
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm really, really worried that,

345
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,520
the left's not going to get its act together.

346
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,840
It's not going to centralise inequality.

347
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,080
The right is going to drive a massive wedge

348
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,040
between the left and the general public,

349
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,520
and the left will not win an election.

350
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,160
And we end up with increasingly

351
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,480
xenophobic governments which veer towards eventually

352
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
racism and,

353
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,080
you know,

354
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,320
look at history, look at history, look at history and

355
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
that's not because I love immigrants.

356
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,000
That's not because I hate immigrants.

357
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,760
That is, you know, I hope

358
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,640
that people can see that

359
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,760
that is my clear eyed economic analysis.

360
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,920
And now, you know,

361
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,520
I've got no skin in the game on this,

362
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,080
you know what I mean?

363
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,040
You know, I'm obviously a white person here in Britain.

364
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,440
You know,

365
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,640
when the immigrants get kicked out,

366
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,120
they probably won't come for me,

367
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,640
you know what I'm saying?

368
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,200
This can really effectively divide the working class.

369
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
Really effectively divide the working class.

370
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
And I'm worried about it.

371
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm worried about it.

372
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,840
So, I'll still be happy

373
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,320
if Jacob Rees-Mogg loses his seat though.

374
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,800
But

375
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,160
there's bigger battles to fight, and,

376
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,280
we need to be united.

377
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,800
And if we can't unite across things like

378
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
race and ethnic origin,

379
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,320
they’re trying to divide us in other lines as well.

380
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
Gender, age,

381
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,520
whether you're from London

382
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,920
or whether you're from the North.

383
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,840
If you own a house or not.

384
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,840
If we’re divided we’ll lose and,

385
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,680
we can't allow that to happen. And,

386
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,400
I wish I had easier ways, I wish I knew how to stop it.

387
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,080
But I'll just keep doing what I do and I hope it works.

388
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,720
And that's all we can do.

389
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
What's that one thing Labour could do when they win?

390
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,200
Labour are going to win.

391
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,480
Like what

392
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,720
can they do in power to stop a kind of rise of...

393
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,560
Labour need to fix the economic problem.

394
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,160
Labour need to fix the economic problem.

395
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,080
But I'll tell you one thing

396
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,760
I think we could do from a comms perspective.

397
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,560
I think we need to...

398
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
We need better class representation.

399
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,680
We need better class representation on TV.

400
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,160
We need better class representation because

401
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,880
I grew up in London,

402
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
I grew up in a very, very immigrant area.

403
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,600
You know, I mean, it's like it's a very Pakistani area.

404
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,560
I grew up, you know.

405
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,840
The kids I grew up with, come from Pakistani families.

406
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,720
Okay. Their religious background is different.

407
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,960
Their cultural background is different.

408
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,480
They've got the exact same economic problems

409
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,520
as my f**king sister,

410
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,800
you know what

411
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,360
I mean,

412
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,880
can't afford the rent, can't afford to buy a house,

413
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,880
can't get decent wage.

414
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,120
Economically we're facing the same problems, you know,

415
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,720
you know, the white working class

416
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,360
and the nonwhite working class face

417
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,280
exactly the same economic problems, you know, and...

418
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,200
If you...

419
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,840
We need to

420
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,920
put working class people...

421
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,120
And it's not just about race, it's about age.

422
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,880
It's about gender.

423
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
It's about whether you're from London,

424
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
whether you're from the North.

425
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,200
You know, we need to put these people together.

426
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,360
We need to

427
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,560
show, show, listen,

428
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,080
these people who might have different backgrounds

429
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,320
and different identities in other ways

430
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,120
have the same economic problems

431
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,960
because we need, you know,

432
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,040
the working class

433
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,080
is very multi-ethnic and it is, you know,

434
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,560
it's older people and younger people

435
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,840
and it's people from London and it’s

436
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,920
people from f**king Grimsby and people from Glasgow,

437
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,000
people from the countryside, you know, it's like.

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,400
We need to be,

439
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,240
I think there's a...

440
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
we need to be...

441
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,840
And, you know, I would like to do it

442
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,240
more on this channel if we, you know,

443
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,640
we struggle for time and we struggle for my energy.

444
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,160
But I would love to get working

445
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,880
class people from different backgrounds,

446
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,200
older people, younger people,

447
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,400
you know, together on this channel

448
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,160
and put them forward.

449
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,360
But

450
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,960
Labour, Labour need to fix the economic problem,

451
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,040
you know, and...

452
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
We need to make it more about class.

453
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,360
You know, we need to make it more about class.

454
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,280
Because if we allow ourselves

455
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,480
to be divided on things like race and,

456
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
it'll be other things as well,

457
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,600
I mean, age is a massive dividing factor

458
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,600
in British politics, and it's not just race.

459
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,320
But, you know, this is one thing

460
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,040
everybody watching can do that, can be like, listen,

461
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,280
can I try to bridge those divisions

462
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,720
rather than build those divisions

463
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,000
and it's not always easy.

464
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,520
But it's something that we have to do.
