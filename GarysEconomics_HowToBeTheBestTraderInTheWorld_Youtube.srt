1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Okay, welcome back to Garys Economics.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,760
Today, we are going to teach you how

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,120
to be the best trader in the world.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,560
Okay, so this is one of the most commonly

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,000
asked questions on the channel, which is "Gary,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,240
the world's going to ****, we need you to help us.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,480
Please, please, please, can you teach us

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,120
how to trade?" And generally, I've avoided

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,840
the question for a couple of reasons.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,360
One, because I think trading is very

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,880
dangerous and probably best avoided for ordinary

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,520
people who are not professionals.

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,920
And secondly, because this channel is

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
about trying to explain how and why the economy

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,840
is collapsing and to teach you what you can

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,560
do to stop your economy from collapsing.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,040
And I think that trading, whilst it

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,320
can make money for the individual, is

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,480
not going to solve this societal problem.

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,000
So I have generally avoided it, but if you have

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
been following this channel for a while, you will

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,840
know that discussing whether or not I am the best

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,560
trader in the world is a very popular pastime for

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,480
the British media, both online and in print.

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,360
I won't comment on that, I'll leave that for

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,920
the trading Ballon d'Or this year to decide

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
who's the best trader in the world.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,680
But, I was Citibank's most profitable

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
trader in 2011, and I have made

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,640
an awful lot of money trading since.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
I've got an extremely good track record and

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
in the last few months, and especially weeks,

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,320
I've been getting really, really frustrated

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,000
by the differences, basically, in the,

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,800
the world of economic analysis within trading

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,520
and in the world that I am in now, which is, I guess,

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,560
you could call it activism or media or politics.

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,040
Basically, trying to prevent

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,440
economic collapse from happening.

40
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,520
So I've become, been becoming super frustrated

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
by the kind of contrast, contradictions between

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
the world of trading and this world I'm in

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,640
now, which I guess is the world of politics.

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,840
And I thought I'd use that opportunity to finally

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,520
answer this question of how do you

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,120
be the best trader in the world.

47
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,320
Really use this as a bit of an opportunity to talk

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,160
about trading, because I kind of, love trading.

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,440
I think it is a beautiful discipline.

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,400
I think it's really dangerous.

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,520
It's something that... It taught me in a

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,880
sense, everything I know about economics today.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,160
So I wanted to talk about it a little bit,

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,600
educate you about it, and give you what you want in

55
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,240
a sense, because I keep getting asked it again and

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,640
again, but I'm going to ask for something in return.

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,400
So I'm going to teach you how to be the best trader in the

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,680
world, and in return, I'm going to ask for two things.

59
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,200
One, please be very, very careful

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,080
if you ever try to do this.

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,320
It's phenomenally dangerous.

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,440
And secondly, I want you to think a little

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,280
bit about what this means for the

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,080
world we live in, for the country that you

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
live in, for your society and your future.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
Because I'm going to explain a little bit

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,960
the way the world of economics works,

68
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,240
in trading, in politics, and I think,

69
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,120
personally, it's phenomenally worrying.

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,320
It's one of the reasons why I started this channel.

71
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,920
So that's it.

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
I'm going to teach you how to trade, and in return, I want

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,440
you to think just a little bit about what it means for

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,000
your society and the future of you and your family.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
Okay, number one.

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,040
What is trading?

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,440
So there's lots of different kinds of trading.

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,520
I was a professional trader for Citibank

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,400
from 2008 until 2014, and

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,320
I am now somebody who trades on my laptop,

81
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,080
using leverage essentially, essentially betting.

82
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,640
There's a few different kinds of trading.

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,320
I also wrote a book.

84
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,360
This is the book that I wrote, The Trading Game.

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
Still in the top 10, would you believe?

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,520
Seven, eight months later after it came out.

87
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,120
And if you read this book, you'll see that there

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,800
are lots of different kinds of traders and there are a

89
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,400
few different kinds of ways to make money in trading.

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
A lot of traders who work for big banks

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,040
tend to make money because they have

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,680
found clever ways to rip people off.

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
But the kind of trading which I am

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,040
most interested in, and which I made my

95
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,560
money on is basically economic forecasting.

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,800
So I'm going to talk about... a little bit about

97
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,240
this kind of trading, economic forecasting as trading.

98
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,480
How does it work?

99
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,440
So basically, I think the simplest way to

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,600
understand is imagine the weather forecast.

101
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,520
So every morning when I wake up, I pull open

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,560
this laptop... not immediately when

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,760
I wake up, but at some point in the morning,

104
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,400
and I'll pull open my trading platform

105
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
and I'll look at all the different prices.

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,680
And when I see that, it is very similar, I

107
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,640
think, to when somebody who is not a trader

108
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,360
maybe looks at the weather forecast in the

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,320
sense, I don't just see a set of prices.

110
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,480
When the prices move, what I see is

111
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,520
changes in what traders are predicting

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,760
about what is going to happen in the future.

113
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,040
And you can bet on that basically.

114
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,760
So trading is betting.

115
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,960
It is gambling.

116
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,440
So I think the cleanest example is, let's say

117
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,240
you looked at the weather forecast and it said

118
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,120
that tomorrow there's a 50% chance of rain.

119
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,720
And you, for whatever reason, because you're the

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,760
world's best meteorologist, I don't know, know that

121
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,440
actually there is, it's almost certainly going to rain.

122
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,040
It's like 95% likely to rain.

123
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,080
You can bet on this.

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,480
And if it's 50%, I've chosen 50% on

125
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,480
purpose, 50% is like exactly 50/50.

126
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,440
That means that the market will, because both sides are

127
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,920
considered equally likely, you should be standing to win

128
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,480
exactly as much as you stand to lose if you're wrong.

129
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,720
You can think, if you prefer, you

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,480
can think of it in terms of sports, in terms

131
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,080
of football, or in terms of betting.

132
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,040
So at the moment, the market thinks that there is a

133
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,920
50% chance that Reform will win the next election.

134
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,400
So I can bet on that

135
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,160
and I say, no, they will definitely win.

136
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,560
And if I'm right, I will double my money.

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,400
I put £100 down.

138
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,480
Because it's 50/50, the amount I

139
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,080
should win if I'm right is 100 pounds.

140
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,800
The amount I should lose if

141
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm wrong is also 100 pounds.

142
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,200
And this is, this is what you do, basically.

143
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,320
It's very, very simple, trading

144
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,840
as economic forecasting, which is

145
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,640
you are looking at what the market thinks,

146
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,520
50%, and you're basically saying, "I think it's

147
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,200
going to be higher. I think it's going to be lower."

148
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,760
Let's shift these numbers about a little bit, right?

149
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,360
Let's say the market thinks tomorrow

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,040
that there is only a 10% chance of rain.

151
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,920
So on 50/50 it was simple, right?

152
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,960
Because it's 50/50, exactly equal, the

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
amount you stand to win should be exactly

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,240
the same as the amount you stand to lose.

155
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,960
But now the market says, "Oh, it's only a 10%

156
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,600
chance of rain." That's like phenomenally unlikely.

157
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,160
Well, it's, let's say it's pretty unlikely.

158
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,440
But you still think it's almost certainly going to rain.

159
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,120
Now because the market thinks the chance of rain

160
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,920
is nine times less than the chance of not rain,

161
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,520
the amount that you stand to win should be nine

162
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
times more than the amount that you stand to lose.

163
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,560
Because what, what you are saying...

164
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,920
the thing that you are saying is going to happen,

165
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,000
everybody thinks, "Oh, that's never going to happen.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
It's phenomenally unlikely." You know?

167
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,200
So you're betting on Manchester United winning the

168
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
league, or something even less likely, like the

169
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,120
Conservatives winning the next election, right?

170
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,760
If you're going to bet on something phenomenally unlikely

171
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,280
like this, then the market will give you more.

172
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,760
So if you bet £100 on it raining tomorrow when

173
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,400
the market says only 10%, or the Conservatives

174
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,960
winning the election, which is actually also

175
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,720
similar odds, about 10%, you should stand to

176
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,600
win nine times more than you stand to lose.

177
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
So if you risk £100, the amount that

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,520
you should win is £900, nine times more.

179
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,840
So trading really is basically

180
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,880
gambling, but you're gambling on economic things.

181
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,080
So when I was a trader, I used to bet a lot

182
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,720
on... When I was a professional trader for

183
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,240
Citibank, I used to bet a lot on interest rates.

184
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,360
And this, again is quite similar.

185
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
So I can actually... I can pull it up now, actually.

186
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,360
We can have a look.

187
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,200
So at the moment the Bank of England

188
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,400
base rate in the UK is 4%, but we can bet

189
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
on what the base rate will be in the future.

190
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,840
So I can bet on what the base rate will be at

191
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,040
the end of next year, and I can put it up now.

192
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,880
And the financial markets think

193
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,320
that the base rate will be 3.45%.

194
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,000
And you can bet on that, basically.

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
And it works in this kind

196
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,280
of higher or lower kind of way.

197
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,960
So if you, for some reason, knew that rates

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,560
were going to stay at 4%, you could basically bet

199
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,600
like a certain, like a number of pounds per

200
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,240
point that it's going to be higher than 3.45%.

201
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,480
So I say, "Okay, it's going to be higher than

202
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,120
3.45." I know rates are going to stay at four.

203
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,240
I bet £100 per .01% and I'll make £100 times 55, which

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,240
is the amount that I was right by, which is £5,500.

205
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,040
And if rates go to zero, I lose much more.

206
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,200
So, really, trading is just gambling it... Just

207
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
in the same way that you could bet on a football

208
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
match, if you bet on something really unlikely, like

209
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,040
Man United winning the league, you'll make

210
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,000
a lot of money.

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,520
If you bet on something really likely, like

212
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,760
Liverpool winning the league, you'll make less money.

213
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Now, let me tell you why I like this.

214
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,480
This kind of system of thinking about the economy

215
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,600
rewards you for a couple of things,

216
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,640
which I think are good and are important.

217
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,360
Number one, it rewards you in particular

218
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,520
for being right when everybody is wrong.

219
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,880
So I was like a counter-trend trader, and I was

220
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,320
looking for things which everybody thought was unlikely.

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
And my big trade, which made me

222
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,280
my big money when I was at Citibank,

223
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,000
was essentially betting that interest rates would

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,360
stay low for a long time after the 2008 crisis.

225
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,760
And I made that bet because I thought the economy

226
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,400
would be weak for a long time after that crisis.

227
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,960
And I believed that because I could see that

228
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,240
ordinary people were struggling financially,

229
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
whereas the rich were accumulating a lot of assets.

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,720
And I knew that ordinary people are essentially,

231
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,560
or were, it's becoming less true,

232
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,960
ordinary people are the driver of the economy.

233
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,040
So I bet on this thing in specifically 2011,

234
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,760
when I was Citibank's most profitable trader

235
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,480
in the world, that the economy would

236
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,160
be really weak, that rates would stay zero.

237
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,040
And the reason I made so much money on that was not

238
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,240
because that happened, but it was particularly because

239
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,040
at that time, at the beginning of 2011,

240
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,320
nobody thought it was going to happen.

241
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,720
So I'd correctly identified this thing, which

242
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,680
was that the economy's ******, ordinary families

243
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
are ******, the economy is going to be weak.

244
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,840
And when I put that trade on at the beginning of 2011,

245
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,680
that's, that was a few years after the Lehman crisis.

246
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,040
Inflation was starting to rise,

247
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,920
and people had been waiting for a long time

248
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
after Lehman crisis for the economy to recover.

249
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,560
And everybody, well, the vast majority of economists

250
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,440
and traders thought the economy was going to recover.

251
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,920
And the reason that I made so much money on that trade

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,680
was not because rates stayed at zero, but

253
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,640
because rates stayed at zero and everybody

254
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,160
thought that rates were going to go up.

255
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,760
And I did a very similar thing

256
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,640
at the beginning of COVID.

257
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,040
So, by the beginning of COVID, I'd

258
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,280
been looking at trading for a long time.

259
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,920
So I'd really fallen into this style of looking at

260
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,640
trading, which is try to understand specifically

261
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,080
what it is that everybody is missing.

262
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,280
So I had become, and still am very

263
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,480
interested in inequality and distribution.

264
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
I think that in general, economists don't

265
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,120
look at or think about inequality or distribution.

266
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,680
So basically, I developed one simple way to very

267
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,080
consistently make money in financial markets, which has

268
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,760
worked very well for me for a long time now, which is

269
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,600
super simple. Whenever anything big happens, understand

270
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,080
what that is going to do to inequality and distribution.

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,360
Because most economists don't think very much,

272
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
especially about inequality of

273
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,720
wealth and distribution of wealth.

274
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
So at the beginning of COVID, I asked myself the

275
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
same question I always ask myself when anything

276
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,200
big happens, "What is this going to do to distribution?

277
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,320
What is this going to do to distribution of wealth?

278
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,480
What is it going to do to the different groups

279
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,600
in society?" And I think... So the first video

280
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,960
I ever did on this channel was in June 2020.

281
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,000
And if you go back and look at it, and I

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,600
think we'll put a link in the description, you will

283
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,120
see that that video is precisely going through that

284
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,800
line of consciousness, that line of thought,

285
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,720
which is understanding, asking some questions

286
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,240
about, "What's happening in COVID economically?

287
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,880
How is that going to affect distribution?

288
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,400
How is that going to affect different groups?"

289
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,640
And it's so easy to make money when you do that

290
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,240
because it is a massive driver of the

291
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,960
economy, and economists never talk about it.

292
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,600
And what I saw very quickly, and if you want

293
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,320
you can go back and see that video, I used to

294
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,400
talk about it loads on the channel, was that the

295
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,080
government would give a huge amount of money out.

296
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
Government debt would increase.

297
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,160
Ordinary people would use that money to pay their rent,

298
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,840
their mortgages, their bills, their food.

299
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,360
It would end up getting accumulated by the rich

300
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,040
people who own the assets that are involved in

301
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,800
providing those services, such as owning the

302
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,520
houses, owning the government debt, owning the

303
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,120
corporations, owning the natural resources.

304
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,640
Money always flows to them when you spend

305
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,880
money, but what was interesting about COVID was,

306
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,520
because luxury spending was banned, these rich

307
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,640
people weren't able to spend the money, and what

308
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,040
you saw was this enormous flood of money from

309
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,960
the government through the poor to the rich.

310
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,120
And the way it was being generally portrayed

311
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,960
in the media at the time was, there was a lot

312
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,800
of focus on, like, furloughed workers, money

313
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,640
is... Or stimulus check if you're in the US.

314
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,400
Money is going to the poor.

315
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,160
Money is going to the poor.

316
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,240
Money is going to the poor.

317
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,680
But what was never really discussed was the fact

318
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
that the poor are spending that money because they're

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,120
not getting their wages, and it's ending up being

320
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,240
accumulated by rich people who can't spend it.

321
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,520
And when we come out of COVID, what you will have is

322
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,600
rich people sitting on these enormous bank balances.

323
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,160
And that was so, so, so easy to monetise, precisely

324
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
because of the same two reasons, which are the

325
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,160
same two things I always think about, which is,

326
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,000
what's happening to inequality and distribution,

327
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,520
because that's the main economic driver and

328
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,960
economists don't look at it, and what element of

329
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,960
that is not being recognised in the narrative?

330
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,760
In 2008, I recognised that the narrative wasn't

331
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,960
recognising that ordinary people, middle-class people,

332
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,160
poor people, were really struggling, and that meant

333
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,200
that the economy would be weak for a long time.

334
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,440
But in COVID, what people didn't realise is that the

335
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,520
rich and the very rich were accumulating enormous

336
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,480
amounts of money, and that that would lead to an

337
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,840
inequality crisis, a cost of living crisis, an

338
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,480
inflation crisis, and most obviously, an asset

339
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,200
price, massive, massive asset price increase, crisis.

340
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,760
So I bet enormously on the gold price going up.

341
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,200
I bought a huge amount of gold right at the beginning

342
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,040
of COVID, and I also bought quite lot of stocks.

343
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,440
And those have done very, very well.

344
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,480
And it's just basically based on

345
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,520
understanding always the same thing, which is,

346
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
economists don't look at inequality.

347
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,720
Inequality is really, at this point,

348
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,440
the main driver of big economic moves.

349
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,840
So if you understand what's going to happen to

350
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,760
inequality, you can understand very easily

351
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,360
what's going to happen to the economy.

352
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,120
So the lesson of this basically answers the

353
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,560
question in the title of this video, "How to be the

354
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,880
best trader in the world." All you really need to do

355
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
to be a very, very good trader from an economic analysis

356
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,840
perspective is understand specifically, "What is it that

357
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,800
is very important that is not being understood by the

358
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,840
majority of economists and traders?" Because if you bet

359
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,720
on something that's definitely going to happen, like, for

360
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,240
example, you know, betting on Liverpool or Manchester

361
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
City winning the league, or, you know, everybody

362
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
knows it's not going to rain tomorrow and you say, "It's

363
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,560
not going to rain tomorrow," you don't make any money.

364
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,520
You make the money when you have correctly identified

365
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,720
something that everybody is wrong about.

366
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,520
And you only need to identify one of these things if

367
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,760
people are consistently wrong about it.

368
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,000
So all of the money I've ever made, and it's

369
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
at this point quite a lot, on trading,

370
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,920
is based on one simple understanding.

371
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,880
Economists do not recognise the macroeconomic

372
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
importance of growing wealth inequality.

373
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,360
And whenever anything happens, I

374
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,040
look at the wealth distribution.

375
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
What's going to happen?

376
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,080
Because the economists are not looking at it, I will

377
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,400
be able to predict things that will happen, such as the

378
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,240
phenomenal weakness after 2008, or the inflation price...

379
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,960
the inflation crisis, cost of living crisis after COVID.

380
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,040
They will not be predicted.

381
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,120
I can predict them.

382
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,360
That's how you make your money.

383
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,320
To be the best trader in the world, you

384
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,960
simply need to identify something that is very

385
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,240
important that the economists have missed.

386
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,720
So now I've spoken about that, I want to talk a little

387
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,280
bit abo- more about why I... I never talk about this on

388
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,800
the channel but it's true... why I kind of love trading.

389
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,760
So there's this one element which is, it rewards you

390
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,120
for recognising things everybody else has missed.

391
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,440
And I don't know if that's just part of

392
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,200
my personality, but I think it's, I think

393
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,040
it's very important for society, right?

394
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,680
Like, if there is something badly wrong

395
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,000
that nobody's noticed, that is the kind of

396
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,120
thing you want to incentivise people to reward.

397
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,720
You know, if you're building a bridge, or let's

398
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,040
say you're building a rocket ship, and everybody

399
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,040
thinks it's going to fly but there's one thing in

400
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,800
there that's going to cause it to blow up, you want

401
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,960
to incentivise people to find that thing, right?

402
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
So trading does this phenomenal thing of

403
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,880
really incentivising and rewarding people

404
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,360
for recognising when everybody is wrong on a thing.

405
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
And I think there's a real beauty

406
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,600
to that and there's an importance to that.

407
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,080
Because most of our methods of analysis

408
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,200
in society, say, be it in politics or in

409
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,680
the media or in academia, they don't really

410
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,880
incentivise or reward people who kind of fight

411
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,400
against or push back against the groupthink.

412
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
And trading does this, and I think that that

413
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,280
is something that is really beautiful and

414
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,040
something that is really useful for society.

415
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,320
Unfortunately, it's not really often used for the

416
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,280
good of society, which is something I'll get into later.

417
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,760
But it does another thing as well, which

418
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,360
is it rewards you for kind of putting

419
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,080
your nuts on the line, on a thing.

420
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,120
So you can do this.

421
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,920
So when I say, as a trader, you only really

422
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,360
need to recognise one thing the economists are

423
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,000
missing, and you just bet on that one thing.

424
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,080
So as a trader, you can make as many bets as

425
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,840
you like, but you can choose what you're going to

426
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,800
bet a lot of money on, and you can choose what

427
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
you're going to bet a little bit of money on.

428
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
So the kind of traders that really, really do

429
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,440
well, in my opinion, are the traders who... at

430
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,760
least this is definitely my side of trading, they

431
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,720
recognise the thing that they are really good at,

432
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,480
the thing that they have a really good understanding

433
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,240
on, and they bet all of their money on that thing.

434
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,560
And I think it's a really good way to recognise and

435
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,800
identify good people, to find people who are willing

436
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,080
to make outrageous predictions that everybody says are

437
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,160
wrong and bet enormous amounts of their own money on it.

438
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,880
And I think this is

439
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,440
such an important element of trading.

440
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,480
And I was talking to Jack

441
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,880
before we shot this about this.

442
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,680
So there's a line from one of

443
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,960
my sort of trading mentors, which is, "Don't tell

444
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,600
me your opinion, tell me your position." And

445
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,080
what he means when he says this, so a position

446
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,240
is what traders call the thing or the group of

447
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,120
things that they have actually bet their money on.

448
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,640
And there's this thing that happens when you're

449
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
a trader, which is you're a young trader and at

450
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,280
some point you're going to put your first big bet on.

451
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,000
And you go into the office and you put your

452
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
big bet on and then you go home and then you sit

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
down, and if you are wrong in this bet, you're

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
going to... you personally are going to lose £100,000

455
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,160
It's your first big trade.

456
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,240
It's your first big bet.

457
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,960
You sit down, and this has happened to me and I think

458
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,880
it has probably happened to any professional trader.

459
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:40,960
You think, "******, am I actually right on that thing?

460
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,720
Because if I'm wrong on that thing, I'm going to lose

461
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,360
£100,000 and that's going to be ****." And then

462
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,400
you start thinking about that trade,

463
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,880
that bet, that ultimately it is an opinion of yours,

464
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,960
and you're going to start... you're going to really start

465
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,480
really thinking, "Is that trade actually right?

466
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Am I actually right?

467
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,360
Is that opinion actually right?" And you

468
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,680
might realise, "Uh, but what about this thing?

469
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,400
I haven't looked at that

470
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,640
I haven't thought about that thing.

471
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,080
What about this thing that that guy said?

472
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,160
Could that be important?

473
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Could this be important?

474
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,280
Maybe I need to research this thing." And

475
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,000
I, basically think once you've experienced

476
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,840
betting a huge amount of your personal money

477
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,160
on what is essentially just an opinion, you start to

478
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,360
fundamentally think about opinions in a different

479
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,600
way that you have never thought about before.

480
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,560
You start to really, really sit and think,

481
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,120
"Are my opinions actually right?" And this is what

482
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,800
my old trading mentor, in the book he's called, Billy,

483
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,000
meant when he said, "I don't care about your opinion,

484
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,440
I want to know your position." Which is basically

485
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,080
once you have been a trader and you have experienced

486
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,680
the concept of putting yourself at risk of facing

487
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,320
enormous personal loss if your opinions are wrong,

488
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,040
you start to really, really think long and hard about

489
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,000
whether your opinions are right or wrong or not.

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And you kind of start to not really care

491
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
about people expressing opinions who are

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,880
not willing to bet their own money on it.

493
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,200
Because you kind of realise that at the end of

494
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,840
the day, opinions that people are not willing

495
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,240
to support with their own, like, financial loss

496
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,040
are often, like, kind of bull****, basically.

497
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,440
And this is what I love about trading.

498
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,600
It force you to not chat bull****, to

499
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,560
really, really interrogate yourself, to really,

500
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,760
really ask yourself, "Am I actually right?

501
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,560
Is that the right answer?" To not just sort of

502
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,160
chat ****, whatever sort of **** works at the time.

503
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,440
It forces you to ask yourself, like, "Which of my

504
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,880
opinions am I really, really, really confident on?

505
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,040
Which ones am I really, really

506
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,880
willing to bet my own money on?

507
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,320
Which ones am I really willing to back myself

508
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,280
on?" And it also rewards you for

509
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,680
recognising when other people are wrong.

510
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,440
And the last thing, which I love about it,

511
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,120
is that it recognises the people who are right.

512
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,680
So as I've said, I was a kind of a counter-trend

513
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,000
trader, which means I was always looking for

514
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
times and moments when the narrative

515
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,080
was wrong, when the consensus opinion was

516
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,680
wrong, when everybody was wrong about a thing.

517
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,240
And when I put my big trade on in 2011,

518
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,200
that the economy would never recover, that was

519
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,160
my first big, like, counter-consensus trade.

520
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,960
And lots of people thought I was wrong.

521
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,920
And, yeah, I love economics, obviously.

522
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,120
And I hired a junior who was, like, fresh

523
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,720
out of Bocconi in Italy, economics graduate,

524
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,480
and we would argue about economics all the time.

525
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,080
And I would argue with a lot of richer,

526
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,240
posher, better-connected people about the economy.

527
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
And very often people would say that I was wrong

528
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,400
because I was taking these counter-trend positions.

529
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,720
They would say, "No, you know, the

530
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,160
economy is, it's getting better.

531
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,200
It's going to be fine.

532
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,080
Things are going to be good.

533
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,960
Things are getting better." And as a trader then,

534
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,520
and to be honest, even still now, because I do still

535
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,200
trade now, when I'm in this kind of situation where

536
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,120
everybody's saying to me, "Again, oh, you're wrong.

537
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,840
No, you're wrong.

538
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,800
Things are going to be fine.

539
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,240
Things aren't going to get worse." The trader

540
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,920
in me, like, really loves it. Because I know

541
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,960
that the more people say I'm wrong, and the more

542
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,040
people think I'm wrong, and the more people argue

543
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,720
I'm wrong, the more money I'm going to make.

544
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,120
And there's something about my personality that

545
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,480
I really enjoy there, and it's this... In a way, it

546
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,600
kind of helps because I have always made money betting

547
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,680
on terrible things, and predicting terrible

548
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,200
things, and I know things are going to get worse.

549
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,480
And as a trader, you have this thing, which is at least,

550
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,760
at the end of the day, I'm going to be right, they're going to

551
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,280
be wrong, they're going to have to give me loads of money.

552
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,400
And at the end of the day, everybody's going to look at

553
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,800
the numbers and they're going to see that I was right.

554
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
And it doesn't stop the world from collapsing.

555
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,560
It doesn't stop the world from being ****.

556
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,160
But what it does do is it forces them to

557
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,240
recognise at the end of the day that you were right

558
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,200
and they were wrong, and that allows you to sort

559
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,680
of at least get a little bit of respect for the

560
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,040
fact that you correctly predicted this disaster.

561
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,760
And this then brings me to the weaknesses of

562
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:25,120
trading, which is as much as you are able to be rewarded

563
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,760
and recognised for correctly identifying big problems in

564
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,240
society, you can't do anything as a trader to fix them.

565
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,360
And this is one of the questions I get asked a lot

566
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,360
when I do interviews, which is people say to me, "Gary,

567
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,320
do you think it was wrong that you bet on society

568
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,320
collapsing and you made so much money?" And

569
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,320
in a sense, that's kind of a funny question because

570
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,240
it kind of assumes that there was like an alternative.

571
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,520
There not... So, there's not a phone

572
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,440
on the trading floor that you can go to and, you

573
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,960
know, ring up the prime minister or the president,

574
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,080
and say, "Hey, listen, I'm Citibank's number

575
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,480
one trader, and I've recognised your economy is

576
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,200
going to collapse, and would you like to do

577
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,760
something about it?" That phone doesn't exist.

578
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,880
What you can do if you want to fix the economy

579
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,960
is basically exactly what I have done, which

580
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,240
is, very, very shortly after becoming

581
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,160
Citibank's most profitable trader, in

582
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,080
2011, I started trying to quit the bank because

583
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,200
wanted to try and stop our society from collapsing.

584
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:45,760
And what I find super interesting is, as a trader,

585
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,160
because I had this very, very good long term track

586
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,440
record of being right, I was very well-esteemed and

587
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,160
very well-respected, and I would get any resources

588
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,960
that I want and I could talk to anybody that I want.

589
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,480
And it was kind of generally recognised that, you

590
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,840
know, Gary is one of the best traders in the bank.

591
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,800
So you have this thing in trading at a bank called

592
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,800
P&L, profit and loss, and it's very visible.

593
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,520
Spreadsheet goes round, everybody can

594
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,720
see everybody else's profit and loss, so

595
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,680
everybody knows who the best traders are.

596
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,800
And because I was number one in 2011,

597
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,200
I was like kind of a bit famous at Citibank

598
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,160
for being like... I was very young in 2011.

599
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,680
I turned 25 at the end of the year.

600
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,320
Everybody was sort of like, "This guy is like one

601
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,640
of the hot young traders." And I got paid a

602
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,920
lot of money and I got given a lot of recognition.

603
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,640
And I... When I came out of trading,

604
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,160
I was kind of a little bit naive.

605
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,560
I kind of thought that, you know, if I can get paid

606
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,760
£2 million a year working for a bank, if I can be

607
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
one of the best traders in the world for one the

608
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,360
biggest banks in the world, surely government and,

609
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,760
and the media and think tanks will want to listen to me.

610
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,680
But the truth is,

611
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,400
really they haven't listened so much.

612
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,720
And I've been out in the world of

613
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,080
public-facing economics for... I actually quit Citibank

614
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,680
in 2014, is when I finally got out, and I've been

615
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,680
speaking very publicly since the beginning of 2020.

616
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,960
And I've really struggled

617
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,640
to get people to listen, really.

618
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,600
And this is the big frustration

619
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,000
I find with being somebody who was a trader and

620
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,680
is now in the world of trying to actually do

621
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,920
something about the economy, which is... When

622
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,800
you're a trader, when I was a trader, and I was a

623
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,960
counter-trend trader, people disagree with you a lot.

624
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,800
And it's fantastic because you're going to make tons of

625
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,760
money, and at the end of the year, everybody's going to

626
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,480
say, "Gary was right." But now in this world of like

627
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,000
public-facing economics, that basically doesn't happen.

628
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So, my first video on this channel in

629
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,320
2020, I... You know, you should go back and

630
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,040
watch it because it's ******* very good, basically.

631
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,120
It was June 2020, the beginning of COVID, when

632
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,200
everybody was still saying, "You know, we're going to

633
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,440
have a really massive economic recovery after COVID,

634
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,640
pent-up demand, roaring 20s." And I correctly predicted

635
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,560
the cost of living crisis, the inflation crisis, the

636
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,680
austerity crisis, the... That there would be a massive

637
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,520
increase in asset prices, house prices.

638
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,680
At the time, The Guardian was

639
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,360
predicting a house price collapse.

640
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,840
Everybody was predicting a massive economic boom.

641
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,080
But my predictions were super correct.

642
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,400
And it's basically for the

643
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,960
same reason it's always been, because I

644
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,680
understand the importance of inequality.

645
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,680
And as somebody who was a trader, you have this

646
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,080
instinct which is like, "Oh my God, I'm going to make so

647
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,240
much money." And, and I did make a load of money, but,

648
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,400
you know, at the end of the year, everybody's going to

649
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,240
see that my predictions are right, everybody else's

650
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,400
predictions were wrong, and then maybe I'm going to be

651
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,560
able to get a little bit of recognition and maybe we're

652
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,760
going to be able to solve this massive economic crisis.

653
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,680
But the truth is, it didn't work out that way.

654
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,600
I made these phenomenal economic predictions

655
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,840
and I made a lot of excellent trades and I made a

656
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,800
lot of money, and the cost of living crisis happened

657
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,880
and the inequality crisis happened and the,

658
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,680
the austerity crisis happened and is happening.

659
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,240
Asset prices went through the roof.

660
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,000
All of these things happened, and I

661
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,360
was kind of screaming to government

662
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,160
that we need to do something about it.

663
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,120
And I got a little bit of coverage in the media.

664
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,240
But this crazy thing happened where basically

665
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
nobody or almost nobody in the public sector cared.

666
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,120
And I think this is the

667
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,000
point that I want to make with you.

668
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,360
We've created an economy where people who are

669
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,120
very, very, very, very good at understanding the

670
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,560
economy will collapse can get paid millions of pounds

671
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,040
a year working for any bank in the City, in Canary

672
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,080
Wharf, in your country's financial district.

673
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,440
But I have been out here speaking publicly about

674
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,920
these things now for very little money, usually

675
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,920
for free, and I have not been able to speak

676
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,320
to or advise any British government for free.

677
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,680
And that is the thing which

678
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,320
you... I want you to understand.

679
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,480
I could get paid millions of pounds a year

680
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,240
working for pretty much any bank in the world,

681
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,840
and I cannot advise the government for free.

682
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,760
So why is that?

683
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,600
And I think the reason for that is primarily because

684
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,160
we have split economics into two worlds,

685
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,200
where we view trading as like practical

686
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,760
economics, and we don't view it as proper

687
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,680
economics, which is kind of academic economics.

688
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,840
And in this public policy world, government,

689
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,720
academia, universities, think tanks, they

690
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,320
want a different kind of economist who

691
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,760
has gone through a more academic route,

692
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,200
and they don't view trading as economic analysis.

693
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,120
So we need to talk quickly about the

694
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,080
question, is trading economic analysis?

695
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,240
So I did my undergrad a long time ago now at

696
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,440
the London School of Economics, which is one of

697
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,360
the most famous and most prestigious economics

698
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,720
universities in the world, probably the most

699
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,040
famous economic specialist university in the world.

700
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,760
It's very hard to get into.

701
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,840
It's, you know, it's full of very, very rich people.

702
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,240
And when I was there, I did maths and economics, and

703
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,120
I want you to understand a little bit about what is

704
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,040
happening in that space, which is when I was there, the

705
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,520
vast majority of the best students wanted to be traders.

706
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,640
And it was very, very difficult to become a trader,

707
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,040
but it was extraordinarily competitive, and most

708
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,720
of the best students were able to become traders.

709
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,840
And that is probably true for most

710
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,000
economics universities across the world.

711
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,480
Then when you get onto the trading floor, what you

712
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,600
find is tons of people absolutely obsessed with

713
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,520
being the best economist, doing the best economic

714
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,680
analysis, aggressively competing, working 100-hour

715
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,480
weeks, waking up at 5:00 AM to be the besteconomist.

716
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,520
The best-paid 10,000 economists in the world

717
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,360
are all traders, every single one of them.

718
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,520
But you are not going to hear their voices on

719
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,920
the news, and they are not going to be advising

720
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,000
your government, and they are not going to be in

721
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,960
the political parties that run your country.

722
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,880
They're not working for your newspapers.

723
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,120
You don't see them on TV.

724
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,640
You don't see them on the internet.

725
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,560
So what we have is this situation where

726
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,400
the vast majority of the best young

727
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,120
economists are desperately trying to become

728
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,920
traders, then the best resourced and the hardest

729
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,840
working economists are pretty much all traders.

730
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,720
And yet you are watching a kind of, in a sense,

731
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,040
like a TV show about economics, which is

732
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,360
the media, the politicians, the central banks.

733
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,040
And they're telling you they are the best economists

734
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,960
in the world, but they are not including any of

735
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
the best paid 10,000 economists in the world.

736
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,800
It's a little bit like you are watching a

737
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,360
football game, and you are being told like, "This

738
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,280
is the Champions League final, the best football

739
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,640
game." And yet none of the 10,000 best paid

740
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,280
footballers in the world are playing in this game.

741
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Basically, you are being governed by and being

742
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,320
spoken to you by third division economists

743
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,200
pretending to be Premier League economists.

744
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,000
And that is where we are, to be honest.

745
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,800
And I was hesitant actually

746
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,600
about putting that line in the video, because

747
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,880
I think part of the reason maybe why I've found it

748
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,680
difficult to get influence in the world that

749
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,960
I'm in now, the world of politics and media and

750
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,240
academia, is because I say things like that that are

751
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,080
not nice to hear for the economists in things like

752
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,360
government and politics and central bank.

753
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,960
And you need to recognise... And the media,

754
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,640
of course, you need to recognise these guys were

755
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,440
at uni with people like me, and they saw most of

756
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,120
their smartest friends go and get these jobs in

757
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,280
the banks and get paid much more than them.

758
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,440
And they kind of don't like it when people

759
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,240
like me come out and say, "All right, guys.

760
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,720
Now, I've made a ton of money, I'm going to tell

761
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,960
you how to do your jobs." And they don't like

762
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
it and then, and they don't listen to me.

763
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,360
But then that raises the question, what do you do?

764
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
What do you do?

765
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,080
If you are somebody who is very, very, very good

766
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,640
at being right on things and has identified

767
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,000
a problem, and you have a field out there like

768
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,800
trading, which is very, very good at aggressively

769
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,040
rewarding people who are right about things.

770
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,560
And then you have another field out there, which is

771
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,160
politics, which kind of doesn't really care if you

772
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
have a track record about being right about things.

773
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,360
What do you do?

774
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,400
How do you actually fix your country?

775
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,160
it's so much easier to bet on things and

776
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,920
make money on things than have any actual influence.

777
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,840
And this is basically what has been frustrating

778
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,920
me in the last couple of years, well,

779
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,360
especially the last couple of months and weeks.

780
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,400
And that is when you're a trader, if you are a very

781
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,840
good trader, it's very easy to make yourself visible

782
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,240
and it's very easy to find the best people and

783
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,720
it's very easy to know who you might talk to

784
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,320
because everybody has this ******* number on their

785
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,400
head, this profit and loss number on their head.

786
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,360
And everybody at, for example, Citibank, knows

787
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,040
who are the most profitable traders on this

788
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,040
trading floor. And if there's a guy over there

789
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,080
in another department, he's very profitable, I

790
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,720
can go and speak to him, and he's going to listen

791
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,000
to me because he knows that I'm very profitable.

792
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,280
And there might be some people that are just

793
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,520
kind of chatting **** or they found a way to,

794
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,440
like, rip somebody off or steal some money.

795
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,040
But you could very easily recognise, who

796
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
are the guys that we should maybe listen to?

797
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,480
Who are the guys that we should maybe discuss with?

798
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,320
And you can very easily make yourself visible as one

799
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,120
of those guys who should be made to be listened to.

800
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,760
And this is why somebody like me from a

801
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,520
very poor background without any connections or

802
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,400
friends, was able to become kind of a legendary

803
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,200
trader within Citibank at the age of 24.

804
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,680
Because trading is a space which allows

805
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,600
people with very good understanding to

806
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,680
make themselves very visible, very quickly.

807
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,400
And I think we can't... we don't have a lot of

808
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,320
space in our society that are like that anymore.

809
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,880
I think the only other place that I can think of,

810
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,120
obviously, which kind of allows very good people to

811
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,120
become very visible at a very young age, is basically

812
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,120
football, or soccer for our American viewers.

813
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,440
That's the only place where, because if you're

814
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,120
really good, you can be visible very quickly.

815
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,520
Whereas, in this world of, like, public-facing

816
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,840
economics, the, the big struggle which I've had

817
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,160
in the last few years is, "Okay, I know I'm right.

818
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,320
I know I'm very good at this.

819
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,720
I know I can make a ton of money on it, but I actually

820
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,200
want to try to stop my society from collapsing.

821
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
How do I get that visibility?

822
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,280
How do I get that visibility?" And

823
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,760
it's been a real struggle.

824
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,240
It's been a real frustration.

825
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,000
And I developed this plan, basically, which was

826
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,840
I saw, and I think it's crazy that I had to do this...

827
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,880
I should probably add quickly before I explain

828
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,120
the plan I developed, I... First of all, I went

829
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,160
back to university, and I thought that I would be able

830
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,920
to say to the economists, you know, show them the way

831
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,200
that they're wrong, give them the data, give them the

832
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,720
evidence, and we could kinda have a discussion about it.

833
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,840
So I went to do a master's at Oxford, 2017 to 2019,

834
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,680
and at that time, I was, you know, just recently, one of

835
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,720
the most profitable interest rate traders in the world.

836
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
We had a lecture about interest rates.

837
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,480
I went to the professor, and I said, "Hey,

838
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,120
you know, do you want to talk about why we've been so

839
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,400
wrong on interest rates for so long?" At that time,

840
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,920
we had been, you know, in every Western country

841
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,720
in the world, pretty much, we'd spent 10 years

842
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,000
predicting that rates would come up very quickly,

843
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,440
which means the economy would normalise very quickly.

844
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,480
And we'd been wrong for 10 years.

845
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,320
And the professor said to me, "Oh, no, we always

846
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,920
knew rates would stay zero forever." Which, was

847
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,440
categorically, provably wrong, and I was amazed by that.

848
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,000
So I sent him the data and I said, "Look, we can

849
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,960
see, actually, you've been wrong for 10 years.

850
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,360
Do you want to talk about it?" And the guy was just

851
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,920
not in the slightest bit interested, basically.

852
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,760
So this is the situation we're in, really.

853
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,240
Academia doesn't really care

854
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,720
about being consistently wrong.

855
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,800
Just after the recent Labour government was elected,

856
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,840
I was able to find myself in a room with,

857
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,720
a senior Labour policy advisor, who I won't name.

858
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,640
And I said the same thing to him.

859
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,400
I was like, "Hey, look, you know,

860
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,880
you've just won the election.

861
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,200
You know, what are going to do about inequality?

862
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,920
Because if you don't do anything about inequality,

863
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,480
then living standards will keep falling, and you

864
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,120
will be very unpopular, very, very quickly." And,

865
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,240
he knew who I was because this was not that

866
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,120
long ago, and his instant reply was

867
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,640
to talk to me about his sort of plan for how they

868
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,760
were going to deal with that from a comms perspective,

869
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,240
which was very frustrating for a policy advisor.

870
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,160
But I think that kind of shows you what is

871
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,920
happening here, which is in trading, we've created

872
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,040
this space where young people, mainly young men,

873
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,480
compete very, very aggressively to be right, to

874
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,680
be right, to be right, to be right, to be right.

875
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,120
And it allows us to relatively easily identify people

876
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,000
who have good understanding and who are right, but they

877
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,240
are then not allowed at all to have a public voice.

878
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,760
And then you have this world of public-facing

879
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,520
economists in things like governments and

880
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,760
universities and think tanks and the media,

881
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,000
and I honestly think most of these guys are

882
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,600
not really trying to be right, unfortunately.

883
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,040
And that's not in a sense their fault.

884
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,560
They are playing a different game, really.

885
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,040
So if you are a trader, you're paid to be right, you're

886
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,120
rewarded to be right, you're incentivised to be right.

887
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,200
But if you are an advisor to government,

888
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,440
your main thing is winning elections, right?

889
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,400
And if you want to win elections, you need

890
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,160
to think about your ******* comms strategy.

891
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,320
So, I don't think it's really a

892
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,080
surprise that Labour policy advisors are

893
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,760
mainly thinking about comms strategy.

894
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,040
And if you are a university professor in economics,

895
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,440
that is an phenomenally competitive job, but you are not

896
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,320
paid to understand why we're wrong on interest rates.

897
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,720
These guys have to write lots of really, really

898
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,880
difficult complicated mathematical papers.

899
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,000
There's this thing called publish or perish.

900
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,960
You have to write more and more complicated

901
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,400
mathematical papers so that... The

902
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,080
economics professors, unfortunately, they

903
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,400
are also not really trying to be right.

904
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,360
You know, if you work as an economist in the media,

905
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,880
realistically, obviously, these guys

906
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,920
are trying to get clicks, right?

907
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,200
That's the way the media works.

908
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,720
That's the way that YouTube works.

909
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,360
These guys working in public service are

910
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,480
not really incentivised to be right, and I

911
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,200
think that is why they don't really care when

912
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,600
somebody like me comes along and says, "Well,

913
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,560
I've got a very good track record of being right.

914
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,200
Do you want to listen?" So, I had to develop

915
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,240
a plan for how do we use this ability to be

916
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,800
consistently right to get ourselves some voice

917
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,600
and some power, essentially, in politics?

918
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,640
And my plan that started in sort of 2020, really,

919
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,280
I thought there was a gap in YouTube.

920
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,920
I thought political power was going to shift to YouTube,

921
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,760
and I thought that the public... The great

922
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,520
thing about YouTube is I can keep doing this

923
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,920
thing which I do, which I have done in this video.

924
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,520
I can say, "Go back and look at the

925
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,040
predictions that I made in 2020.

926
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,080
Go back and watch the videos I made in 2020."

927
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,720
And I think that gives me a lot of credibility

928
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,040
because you can see I'm not just some guy

929
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,760
who's trying to, like, get clicks on YouTube.

930
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,200
I'm a guy who has a very long

931
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,440
track record of being right.

932
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,640
And, and the reason why my videos in 2020 have correct

933
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,960
predictions is the same reason I was Citibank's

934
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,120
best trader in the world,

935
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,160
which is, I'm ******* good

936
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
at this and I actually have a good understanding.

937
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,080
And I think YouTube, in going directly

938
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,200
to the people, maybe gives us a way... Well,

939
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,120
I was hoping would give us a bit of a way

940
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,960
to get leverage over the public.

941
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,640
I needed to build that plan out, so I needed to

942
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,400
figure out how to bring the audience to the YouTube,

943
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,440
which is really why I wrote the book.

944
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,240
And that was phenomenally successful.

945
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,640
And now we get, you know, half a

946
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,080
million, a million views on every video.

947
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,760
And I was kind of thinking, hoping, now that I

948
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,600
am not only formally best trader in the world for

949
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,320
Citibank, but also have a very good track record

950
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,840
of predicting online and am also the biggest

951
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,640
politics show in the country, bigger than Question

952
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,320
Time, maybe now the politicians will listen to me.

953
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,080
But the truth is, unfortunately,

954
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,680
it seems that they still won't.

955
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,680
And now you have a political party that is

956
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,240
supposed to be the center-left political party, so

957
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,280
stubbornly refusing to do anything about inequality and

958
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,600
taxation of the rich that not only will they collapse

959
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,080
the economy, they will also lose disastrously to a

960
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,520
new far-right political party in the next election.

961
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,120
And they still won't listen.

962
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,800
And it's insane and it's frustrating, and

963
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,320
it forces us to ask the question, what can we do?

964
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,520
Okay, so that is it.

965
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,640
That is where we are.

966
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,440
If you want to be the best trader in the world,

967
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,960
all you need to do is understand something that

968
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,920
nobody else in the world, or the vast majority of

969
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,400
economists, don't understand about the economy.

970
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,800
And, if you want something, I'll tell you it, the

971
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,960
exact thing I've made pretty much all my money on.

972
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,840
Growing inequality of wealth is destroying the economy

973
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,520
and pretty much everything that happens

974
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,760
can be predicted by understanding what will

975
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,560
happen with growing inequality of wealth.

976
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,160
The irony of this is, this is exactly the

977
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,200
message that I've been sending you in pretty

978
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,240
much every video for the last five years.

979
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,720
So every single person who has sent me the message,

980
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,040
"Can you please teach me, how to be the best trader

981
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,360
in the world?" has failed to realise that that is

982
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,600
exactly what I've been doing for the last five years.

983
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,000
If you want to understand the economy better

984
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,280
than the economists, you can do that very, very

985
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,920
simply by understanding that growing inequality

986
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,240
of wealth is a massive economic driver.

987
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,320
And that's true if you want to be a good trader,

988
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,160
and it's true if you want to be in government.

989
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,400
But the quid pro quo was that I asked you to think

990
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,360
about what this system will do to our society.

991
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,120
So we have a system which very aggressively

992
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,120
takes all of our best young economic minds, sends

993
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,080
them to skyscrapers to bet on the end of the

994
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,040
world, and doesn't allow them to speak publicly.

995
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,040
And when one of those traders comes out of the

996
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,320
skyscrapers and tries to tell the academics,

997
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,160
the media, the politicians that their society is

998
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,200
going to collapse, for free, despite being worth

999
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,640
a couple of million pounds a year according

1000
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,320
to the banks, the governments don't listen.

1001
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,240
What will that do to our society?

1002
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,520
What will that do to our future?

1003
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,400
So that's it, how to be

1004
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,480
the best trader in the world.

1005
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,040
Leaving it on that note is a little bit depressing.

1006
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,600
And the truth is, I've been a little bit

1007
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,960
depressed the last couple of months because we've

1008
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,120
achieved so much here on this channel, and it is

1009
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,920
so obvious that the governments need something new.

1010
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,200
And I think it should be unbelievably

1011
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,560
painfully obvious that what they need is us.

1012
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,600
And yet they look like they are going to basically

1013
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,480
commit suicide, die on the hill of not taxing the rich.

1014
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,600
And that is depressing.

1015
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,520
But I've told myself that in this new series,

1016
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,640
we're not going to end the video on any depressing notes.

1017
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,000
So I want to finish by giving a

1018
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,880
little bit of a message of hope.

1019
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,840
I don't think I've spoken

1020
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,280
about this on the channel before.

1021
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,920
People sometimes ask me,

1022
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,280
"What are you hopeful about?

1023
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,400
What are you hopeful about?" And a few

1024
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,080
years ago, just when Rishi Sunak had been

1025
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,920
recently... Was he, was he just made Chancellor?

1026
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,360
Was he just made Prime Minister?

1027
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,000
I got sent to a little military town

1028
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,720
in North Yorkshire called Colburn,

1029
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,120
which is Rishi Sunak's constituency.

1030
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,360
And the plan was for me to go there, to go to a

1031
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,880
food bank, and talk to some food bank users

1032
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,000
about how they feel about their new... about their

1033
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,560
MP being the richest MP in the history of the country.

1034
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,160
And I didn't love that idea because I thought

1035
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,960
it was a little bit like poverty p**n, but

1036
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,920
I went along with it because I thought, you

1037
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,520
know, we might get some views, whatever.

1038
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,040
I wasn't that famous at the time.

1039
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,640
And when I went there, what I found was the

1040
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,920
food bank was not being used as a food bank.

1041
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,320
And the reason for that was that it was the

1042
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,160
weekend after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

1043
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,200
and the food bank had been rapidly turned

1044
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,720
into a kind of supply collection center.

1045
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,680
So people were sending in, you know, tinned

1046
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,320
food and warm clothes and medicines and

1047
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
stuff for babies and stuff like that.

1048
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,400
And the food bank was full of people, like, sorting

1049
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,400
this stuff out, packing it into boxes, and they were

1050
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,560
going to put the boxes into a van and these people from

1051
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,040
North Yorkshire were going to drive themselves the van

1052
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,320
all the way to Ukraine to deliver these supplies.

1053
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,400
And it kind of ****** my plan really, because the

1054
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,440
food bank wasn't being used as a food bank, so

1055
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,320
it wasn't full of these poverty p**n food bank

1056
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,000
users, the poorest people in the area.

1057
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,640
But, you know, what else can you do?

1058
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,800
I helped them, like, pack stuff

1059
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,480
into boxes and I got talking to them.

1060
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,480
And what I found out when I was talking to them

1061
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,080
was that they were the food bank users.

1062
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,440
The people that were there in the first

1063
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,760
week of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

1064
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,440
packing stuff into boxes, making donations

1065
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,880
to drive to Ukraine, were food bank users.

1066
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,000
People who, in normal times,

1067
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,440
struggle to feed their kids.

1068
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,120
And yet when something bad happened to a bunch of people

1069
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,040
from a different country with a different language

1070
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,040
thousands of miles away, their first instinct was to go

1071
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,520
down to the food bank and pack stuff into boxes to help.

1072
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,040
And when I see what's happening today, I spoke

1073
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,720
in last week's video about going to the recent

1074
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,000
protests outside the hotels and seeing people on

1075
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,800
different side of the road shouting at each other,

1076
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,520
sometimes I worry that that vision, two

1077
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,880
separate groups of people standing on opposite

1078
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,200
sides of the road shouting names at each other,

1079
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,240
is kind of a metaphor for our future as a country.

1080
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,520
And when I feel that way, I try to remember back to

1081
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,760
this day that I went to Colburn in North Yorkshire,

1082
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,080
in a very poor, very deprived area, and seeing

1083
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,240
the poorest people in our country packing stuff

1084
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,280
into boxes to help people thousands of miles away.

1085
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,320
Because I suspect that some of those people might

1086
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,840
be some of the same people going to these protests.

1087
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,720
What that tells me is that this country,

1088
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,920
and I'm sure it's true in your country too,

1089
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,640
is not full of bad people.

1090
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,600
These people want a positive vision for the future.

1091
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,400
If we provide that, they will support us.

1092
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,760
And I want to do a shout-out here to all of the

1093
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,200
economists who might be watching in the Labour

1094
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,440
Party, in the Democratic Party, in whatever

1095
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,600
political party all over the world, in the

1096
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,040
universities, in the think tanks, in the media.

1097
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,360
I might have given the impression that I don't

1098
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,840
think you guys are the smartest people in the world.

1099
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,200
You have an important part to play.

1100
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,080
You have an important part to play.

1101
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,360
I'm here.

1102
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,000
I'm ready to build it.

1103
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,880
If we create a story that will save ordinary

1104
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,320
people from poverty, ordinary people across

1105
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,880
the world are ready to get behind it.

1106
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
So that's it.

1107
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
How do you be the best trader in the world?

1108
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,480
You bet on the end of the world.

1109
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,280
But maybe we should stop the end of the world.

1110
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,360
Tax wealth, not work.

1111
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,000
Make things better.

1112
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,800
Support the channel, tell your friends, tell your mum.

1113
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,280
Thank you.
