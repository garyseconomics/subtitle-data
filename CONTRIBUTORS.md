This is the official list of contributors.
This file is distinct from the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.md) file, as that lists the copyright holders; this file lists people.
For example, employees under a contract where the organization owns their copyright are listed here but not there, where their organization is listed instead.

When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file, either their name or their organization's name should be added to the AUTHORS file, depending on who owns the copyright.

Names should be added to this file as:

* Name (github-username or email-address)

Please keep the list alphabetically sorted by first name.

* Dave Crossland (@davelab6)
