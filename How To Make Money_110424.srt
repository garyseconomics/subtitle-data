1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,280
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,240
Today we are going to talk about how to make money.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,600
So this is one of the questions...

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,400
Well not just one of the questions, the question,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,320
by a million miles

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,560
which I get asked most on the channel.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
And I also get asked this question a lot in real life.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,880
So I wanted to address it.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,520
And I got asked this question twice recently in person.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,560
I went to

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,400
a friend of mine's 50th birthday party,

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,920
and his nephew was there,

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,760
and we were standing outside this pub

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,560
and he said to me, oh,

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,840
you know, you're that guy, I watch your channel.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,680
You know, what do I do?

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,200
What do I do?

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,600
How do I get rich?

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,720
And, I had another friend of mine,

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,360
a Japanese guy, come out to my house.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
We were cooking dinner,

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,520
and he said, I want to ask you, like,

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,520
you know, you've got a lot of money.

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,560
Can you tell me how to get rich? And,

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
it's a tricky one, right?

26
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,400
Because I was thinking when this second guy asked me,

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,520
if you came to me and said, you know,

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,320
how do I get hench?

29
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,240
I would say, go to the gym every day.

30
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,720
If he said to me, you know,

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
how do I get my English better?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,360
I would say, you know, speak English every day.

33
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,320
If you say, how do I learn Japanese?

34
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,400
I'll show you what textbooks to buy.

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,480
but the truth of the matter is what I said to this guy.

36
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,760
He said, can I ask you one question?

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,640
I said, yeah, go on. He said, how do I get rich?

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,720
I said to him, ask another question,

39
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,640
because the truth is,

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,960
this is the one thing

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,120
which is almost impossible to safely do

42
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,280
as a young person nowadays.

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,680
There's there's basically one really,

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,360
really good method for getting rich in today's society.

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,480
It’s almost foolproof. Have a rich Dad.

46
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,840
If you failed that one,

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,880
try again.

48
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,800
Because,

49
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,920
okay, so obviously people ask me this question

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
because I'm a rich person.

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
I've been very open about that.

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
I talk about this on the channel.

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,560
I made my money working as a trader.

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,720
I was a very good trader.

55
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,760
I was a very successful trader.

56
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,480
I wasn't a professional trader for a long time.

57
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,880
I worked as a trader from 2008 to 2014.

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,560
I made a lot of money,

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
especially in 2011,

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,160
but also a couple of years around that.

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,320
If you can get a job as a professional trader,

62
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,800
it's an extremely well-paid job

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,680
and you will become a relatively rich person.

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
Basically, nobody,

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
not from a rich background, becomes a trader nowadays.

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,840
It's almost impossible to get that job.

67
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,200
And I got that job

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,120
partially because I was a very good student,

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,880
you know, I was a very talented maths student.

70
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,160
I got very good grades.

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,880
I got into a very good university,

72
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
and I got very good grades at that university.

73
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,160
But even on top of that,

74
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,840
I needed to win like a national card game

75
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,600
to get that job.

76
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,320
And I think that shows you...

77
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,960
this story’s in my book, if you want,

78
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,480
you can read my book, it tells you about this.

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,000
It's almost impossible for ordinary people to get that

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
job nowadays. So

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,560
unless you are like a kind of like a extremely,

82
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,360
unbelievably talented mathematician,

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
in which case, you know,

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
go and study maths or economics

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,440
at Oxford, Cambridge, LSE,

86
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,080
and try and get a job as a trader.

87
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,960
This is just not a route that is open to you.

88
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,640
You know, the trading floor has almost

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,600
nobody from a poor, ordinary background,

90
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,280
almost everybody is from a rich background.

91
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,920
So if you come to me from an ordinary background,

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,240
say, how do I get rich?

93
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,960
I can't really say to you, do what I did

94
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,280
because it's almost impossible for you to do that.

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,440
So then you might say, okay, well,

96
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,160
you know, maybe I can't get a job as a trader, but,

97
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,760
you know, you still trade personally.

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,080
And I do still trade personally.

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,880
And I've got a very good track record

100
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,640
trading personally.

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
I have made quite a lot of money trading personally

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,640
since I quit trading.

103
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,600
so you might say, well, teach me how to trade.

104
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,360
So for this,

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
I've mentioned this a couple of times

106
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,080
before on the channel.

107
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,360
I have a couple of times tried to help

108
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,120
friends get involved in trading.

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,800
And this happened

110
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,360
particularly at the beginning of Covid.

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,080
So I sort of started doing my public work

112
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,920
at the beginning of Covid in 2020.

113
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,120
And one of the big things that I said

114
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,400
when I came out publicly was that

115
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,920
house prices would go up a lot because of Covid,

116
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,400
because rich people accumulated a lot of money

117
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,960
during Covid.

118
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,240
You can go and look at my early videos,

119
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,680
how the rich get rich from Covid 19.

120
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,000
I talk about exactly this.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,160
And some of my friends who were trying to buy

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,360
houses, had maybe 50, 60 grand saved up,

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
came to me saying, listen, I'm worried.

124
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,760
You said house prices would go up.

125
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't have a big enough deposit yet.

126
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,840
I can't buy a house. What can I do?

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
And at that time, at the beginning of Covid,

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
I was making some really big bets.

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,280
In particular,

130
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,480
I had a really big bet that the gold

131
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,360
price would go up, and,

132
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,520
I thought the gold price would go up.

133
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,280
It has come up a lot.

134
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
I thought house prices would go up.

135
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,400
They have come up a lot.

136
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,760
And actually like quite a good way

137
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,160
to hedge your exposure to rising house prices

138
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,040
is to buy other assets like gold.

139
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,120
So I said to my friends, okay, well,

140
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,080
you can't buy a house yet,

141
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,120
but what you can do is you can buy gold.

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
I had a massive trade on that

143
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
the gold price would go up,

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
so I felt quite comfortable recommending to them

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
to do the same thing that I was doing.

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
And yeah, it was a good trade recommendation.

147
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
Gold price went up. A lot has gone up a lot since.

148
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
And the gold price went up about 20%

149
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,760
not long after that recommendation.

150
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,240
And then it came down sort of 5%.

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
And sort of

152
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
when this happened, about nine months later,

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
both of my friends called me up

154
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,920
and they said, you know, what do we do?

155
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,520
They call me up individually, you know, what do I do?

156
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,080
And I said, well, you know,

157
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,800
it's gone up 20% is down 5%.

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,240
So you’re still up a lot of money,

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,760
like just don't do anything, just sit.

160
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,280
Wait.

161
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,920
You know,

162
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,880
if you want, you can buy a little bit more on this dip.

163
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,200
and they both said, you know, you don't understand.

164
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,720
Like I'm out. I'm wiped out. I've lost all my money.

165
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,920
And I was confused, how could you have lost money?

166
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,000
It’s up 15% since I told you to buy.

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
And they both did basically the same thing,

168
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,920
which was they didn't do anything when I said buy it,

169
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,560
because at the time it looked terrible

170
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,440
because the price is really low.

171
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,800
It went up 5% and they thought,

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
oh damn, I should have bought it.

173
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
It went up another 5%.

174
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,920
And they thought, oh man, I really should have bought.

175
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,080
I'm going to buy now.

176
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,360
So straight away they missed the first 10%

177
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,840
goes up another 5% and they make a little bit

178
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,760
more on it.

179
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,080
The okay great I made some money.

180
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,360
They buy a little bit more,

181
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,640
goes up another 5%

182
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,960
and then they both just basically went totally insane

183
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,200
and didn't say anything to me.

184
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,760
They bought a ton more gold.

185
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,480
They bought silver, they bought platinum,

186
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,840
they bought palladium, they bought Bitcoin.

187
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,760
They're buying Tesla.

188
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,000
Not telling me any of this stuff basically

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
because they’d made a little bit of money

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,480
trading on my recommendation.

191
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,040
They basically became sort of convinced

192
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,520
that they themselves are really good traders. And they

193
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,240
did a load of stuff, which I didn't tell them to do.

194
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,040
And they bought loads basically

195
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,720
and then it came down and they lost a ton of money.

196
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,280
So this is why I don't try and teach people

197
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
to trade, basically.

198
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,840
You know,

199
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
the few times I've given friends

200
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,320
trading recommendations,

201
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,120
most of the time they manage to lose a ton of money

202
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,360
because trading hard.

203
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,880
And you know, I make money as a trader.

204
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,160
And every now and again

205
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,960
I do say my positions on the channel,

206
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,920
but I was a professional trader for six years,

207
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,200
and I've been looking at the economy for 20 years.

208
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,160
And, you know,

209
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,600
I have an extremely good track record

210
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,080
as a professional trader,

211
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,120
an extremely good track record

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,160
as a as a personal trader.

213
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,880
I don't think this is

214
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,920
a thing which I can teach you to do,

215
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,400
you know what I mean, you know.

216
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,680
It's a bit like going and asking Usain Bolt,

217
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,280
how can I win the Olympics?

218
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,280
You know, like maybe train for 20 years?

219
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,400
I just don't think it's,

220
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,640
I don't think it would be responsible.

221
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,000
I think it'd be super dangerous.

222
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,960
I know that trading has become

223
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,800
super popular for young men on the internet.

224
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,160
And you see them on Instagram

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
showing off their Lamborghinis.

226
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,320
I've come out and,

227
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,400
you know, very aggressively said,

228
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
I think crypto trading is dangerous

229
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,720
and day trading is dangerous

230
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,320
and FX trading is dangerous.

231
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,160
And for that reason, I get, you know,

232
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,920
young men emailing me all the time

233
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
telling me they've lost all their money

234
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,720
FX trading, crypto trading,

235
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,600
and a lot of the time when they send me those emails,

236
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,520
they say, but don't worry, I figured it out now

237
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,880
and for me, I'm going to make money.

238
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,880
And, it's difficult to read those emails.

239
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,200
Listen, trading is gambling.

240
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
Trading is gambling.

241
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
If you go on...

242
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
I trade on IG index,

243
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
which is a spread betting platform.

244
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,480
It says there on the front page,

245
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,120
like 75% of accounts lose money. I'm not losing money.

246
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
And there's professionals on there like me

247
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,440
that are not losing money.

248
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,760
And there's an old saying,

249
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,520
if you don't know who the idiot is

250
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,840
at the poker table, you’re the idiot.

251
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,200
Listen, professional traders like me,

252
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,120
if you go out, you're trading against me, you know.

253
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,200
And it's dangerous.

254
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,600
It's a dangerous thing for ordinary people to do.

255
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,040
I think we've created this situation

256
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
now where we have basically convinced

257
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,160
young people, especially young men, that

258
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
the only way to be of

259
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,320
value in society is to make a lot of money

260
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
and we've created a situation

261
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,760
where all of the legitimate paths

262
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
to getting rich are basically blocked,

263
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,920
and it's almost impossible to become rich nowadays.

264
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,600
Realistically,

265
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,920
for the younger generation,

266
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,280
if you're working, you've already lost.

267
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
Basically, it's almost impossible

268
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,280
to get rich through your work.

269
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,880
The only way to get rich nowadays

270
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,320
is to inherit money from your parents.

271
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,000
But often these inheritances are invisible.

272
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
So I went to a grammar school

273
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,320
but I also went to a comprehensive school,

274
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,760
and I've got friends from different kinds

275
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,280
of financial backgrounds.

276
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,040
People from poorer families,

277
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,200
it's basically impossible to buy property.

278
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,160
People from richer families, what happens is

279
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
the parents will gift them

280
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,800
£100,000, £200,000, maybe £500,000 to buy property.

281
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,720
People from poorer backgrounds

282
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,640
don't realise that that's happened behind the scenes.

283
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,720
So they see other people

284
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,440
from different families buying properties, and they...

285
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,160
people don't tend to go and say, you know,

286
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,560
the reason I bought a property

287
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
is because my mum gave me £500,000,

288
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,240
but that is what is happening.

289
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Then people from poorer backgrounds

290
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,480
see these guys buying property

291
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,440
and they think, what are they doing

292
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
that I'm doing wrong?

293
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,080
And the thing that you're doing wrong

294
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,040
if you're poor is you had the wrong parents.

295
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
You shouldn't have done that.

296
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,600
You should have had the right parents.

297
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,200
This is the world that we live in nowadays.

298
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,920
We live in a world

299
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,200
in which the only way to get rich

300
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,120
is to have rich parents.

301
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,640
And yet we tell young people,

302
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
if you are poor, you are a failure. You are a loser.

303
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
It is your fault.

304
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,240
And this is just absolutely devastating

305
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,520
for the mental health of young people.

306
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,120
So what I want to say is, listen,

307
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,440
you live in a rigged game.

308
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,560
You and I live in a rigged game.

309
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,200
It is almost impossible to get rich

310
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,720
if your parents are not rich.

311
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,240
So what I want you to do is to accept that.

312
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,720
The game is rigged,

313
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
and to stop judging yourself

314
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
and other people based on financial outcomes

315
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
when financial outcomes are increasingly nothing to do

316
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,200
with how smart you are,

317
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,800
how hard you work, what job you do.

318
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,760
You know this is the world that we live in.

319
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,680
But I think

320
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,280
what obfuscates this a little bit

321
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,760
is the fact that there is social mobility

322
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
on like the micro scale.

323
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
So like the people who come

324
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,760
from the same financial background as you,

325
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,800
if you work harder than them and get a better job,

326
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,840
you will be able to get slightly better off than them.

327
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,680
But you will never be able to jump up

328
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,240
to the level of somebody whose parents are richer.

329
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,080
So that's what it is. So at the same time,

330
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,640
you know, especially if you're poor,

331
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,240
you do have to work really hard

332
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,640
and you do have to try and study the right subjects.

333
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,800
You do have to try and get the right job,

334
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
because increasingly

335
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,160
people are put in this situation where otherwise

336
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,480
you'll become homeless and completely impoverished.

337
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,800
So you have this kind of small scale

338
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,200
competitiveness. But there's no macro competitiveness.

339
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
So you're forced to compete

340
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
with other people who are poor,

341
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,600
but you have no way of competing

342
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,240
with people who are born richer.

343
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,000
And it's a horrible game. It's a horrible game.

344
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,280
It's a horrible game. So I think we need to.

345
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,320
You need to understand that

346
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,160
this is the world that you've been put in.

347
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,880
They want you to fight each other to be rich, but

348
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,480
it's impossible to be rich,

349
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,720
because the rich are taking everything.

350
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,000
So while you are sort of being convinced

351
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,120
to fight each other and obsess

352
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,680
about being a failure and obsess about making money,

353
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,320
the game is being rigged such that you and the middle

354
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,920
classes are basically being robbed blind,

355
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,240
and the government is being robbed blind.

356
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
And

357
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,360
my concerns are one devastating

358
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,720
for the mental health of young people.

359
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,960
But two, it's like really,

360
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,800
really deeply depoliticising.

361
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
I think if you can convince

362
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,360
ordinary young people

363
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,400
to focus only on their specific bank balances

364
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,480
whilst the game is rigged,

365
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,640
so that it's very easy for the rich to rob the poor,

366
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,920
then the poor will never unite

367
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,080
and stop that theft basically. So,

368
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,160
this is the world we're living in

369
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,880
and this is the thing

370
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,280
which I worry about a lot at the moment,

371
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,800
which is how do we stop the systemised

372
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,280
robbing of the poor

373
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,800
when the poor have been really trained

374
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,240
to play the game, very individualistic

375
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
and to not work together?

376
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,760
And I think, if I want to send one message, it is that

377
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
the game is set up in a way that

378
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,520
you are being robbed of your wealth,

379
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,160
and there's very little

380
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,560
you could do as an individual to stop that.

381
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,040
But no matter how much they rob you of your wealth,

382
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,000
they can't rob you of your dignity and

383
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,280
it's not your fault

384
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,160
that you live

385
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,920
in increasingly in poverty,

386
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,160
the game is being set up

387
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
such that the majority of this country

388
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
increasingly will live in poverty.

389
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,840
But you can realise that

390
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,320
that's not fair on you, as an individual

391
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,600
that is the result of a rotten system,

392
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,600
is the result of a rotten system. And,

393
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
I think people can deal with poverty.

394
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,800
And I know poverty is not easy, but, you know,

395
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,760
I grew up in poverty and it was hard.

396
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,800
But what affected me

397
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,200
in many ways, more than the poverty was,

398
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,480
was the judgment. So,

399
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,320
don't judge yourself harshly and don't judge

400
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
other people harshly because it's a system

401
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,520
that's broken.

402
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,040
You should be proud of the work that you do,

403
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,800
and you should be proud

404
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,120
of what you do to support yourself

405
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,960
and to support your family

406
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,280
and support the people around you.

407
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,600
Because I think once we managed to shake off

408
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,080
this judgment and this idea that it's our fault,

409
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,760
then we can start

410
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,240
being proud of ourselves and each other

411
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
and seeing the game for what it really is,

412
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,840
which is a broken game that we have to fix together.

413
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
So

414
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,720
there's only two ways to be rich

415
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
in this world that we live in.

416
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,520
Be born rich or change the rules.

417
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,120
and we can only change the rules together.

418
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,960
So I'm going to try to change the rules.

419
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,360
Tax the rich more, tax you less,

420
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,200
move us back into an economy

421
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
where ordinary people

422
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,520
like my parents, like your parents,

423
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,240
can achieve financial security

424
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,040
and even wealth by hard work.

425
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
But the only way to do that

426
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,200
is to work together to change the system.

427
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,240
So how do you get rich?

428
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,360
You get rich by working together.

429
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,640
I'm going to try and do that, and I hope you join me.

430
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,760
Good luck. Thank you.
