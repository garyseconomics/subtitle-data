1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,240
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Today we are going to talk about passive income.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,280
Okay. So passive income

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,600
is a big sort of trend on the internet.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,240
The smart way to make money is to have passive income.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,880
Don't work for your money. Generate passive income.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,160
And I thought it would be nice to open up a little bit

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,360
and explain

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,400
what actually passive income

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,520
is from a broad economic perspective.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,520
So the first thing to say is

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,360
we live in an economy and most of us work,

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,960
and a lot of stuff is produced every year.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,120
A lot of goods and services are produced every year.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,520
When I work, when you work,

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,320
we produce stuff, we make stuff.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,880
And every year that stuff is consumed

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,600
by different people in society.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,960
So some people consume an awful lot,

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,400
spend a lot of money, consume

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,760
a lot of goods and services, have a very luxurious life

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,040
and other people live very basic,

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,680
barebones, essential lives

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,800
where they live almost lives of poverty.

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,880
So what is produced and who consumes it?

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,200
Well, basically everything that is produced

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
every year is consumed by somebody.

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,480
And some of it goes to workers.

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,040
You know, you probably work a job

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
and you consume things.

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,200
For example, you live in a house and you will eat food,

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
and if you're lucky, you might get a holiday or two.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
You might go to the pub, you might go to a restaurant.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,760
Some of the stuff goes to workers, but a lot of people

35
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,960
get a lot of money that they don't work for.

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,920
This is their passive income, and they get to consume

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,360
more, basically.

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
And this passive income essentially

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,440
goes to the people who own the assets.

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,480
So we talk a lot on this channel about what is wealth.

41
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,440
If you don't watch that video, I strongly recommend it.

42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,240
Most people never get to own

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,960
significant amounts of wealth

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,200
other than the house they live in.

45
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,480
Most people are quite preoccupied

46
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,280
to own the house

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,240
they live in because it's very difficult to do,

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,400
and they never get to own

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
a lot of the other forms of wealth

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,120
that exist in society.

51
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,440
But there are huge amounts of wealth

52
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,360
assets involved in our economy

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,040
and the production of the things we produce.

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,840
So most obviously

55
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,240
there are the shops on the high street,

56
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,960
there are the office blocks.

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,160
There's a lot of skyscrapers here,

58
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,520
office blocks people live in.

59
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,800
There's also the natural resources.

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
There's the supermarket,

61
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,160
there's all of these buildings

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
that are involved in producing things.

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,760
There's factories, there's farms,

64
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,120
and all of these are owned by somebody.

65
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
And basically every year

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,080
the things we produce,

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,600
some of it goes to

68
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,000
people who work as payment for their work,

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,520
and some of it goes to people who own

70
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,640
as payment for ownership. So

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,160
behind this concept of passive income

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,880
is basically the question of who owns our economy?

73
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,320
And whoever owns our economy,

74
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,800
whoever owns our assets,

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,680
they will receive a massive chunk

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,960
of what we produce as a society each year.

77
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,600
So here

78
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,320
we have the basic concept of passive income,

79
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
and it's related to a video

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,760
we did a few weeks ago

81
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,840
saying that rent, interest

82
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,960
and profits are all the same thing,

83
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
which is

84
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,680
there's a set of cash flows which go to owners

85
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,520
every single year.

86
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
And these owners,

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,840
they get cash flows from you

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
and that's their passive income.

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,280
But there is another type of passive income

90
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,320
which is very

91
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,120
heavily marketed, especially on things like TikTok,

92
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,320
especially American TikTok,

93
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,960
which is basically saying borrow a ton of money

94
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,800
buy assets, normally housing, and rent them out,

95
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,120
and then you can make a passive income.

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,480
So this is quite interesting, right?

97
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,200
You're actually making a passive

98
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,960
income by borrowing money from the rich

99
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,200
so that you can buy assets

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
and then rent them out to poorer people.

101
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,320
And I think this kind of exposes a little bit

102
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,440
how our economy works,

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,320
because here you have people who might themselves

104
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,360
not particularly be rich,

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,480
who are basically paying

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,920
to, kind of,

107
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,080
manage the assets of the very rich kind

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,960
of standing between the very rich and the rest of us.

109
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,240
And if you look at these landlords,

110
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,560
they're often themselves not extremely rich people,

111
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
but they're essentially basically,

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,040
they're working as estate agents for the rich.

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,160
And I think it kind of shows you

114
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
the kind of society we've built

115
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,480
where really the rich own increasingly everything.

116
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,320
And you basically get paid

117
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,000
based on your proximity to the rich.

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,800
So, for example, I was working for a large bank

119
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,960
and I was basically managing

120
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,040
huge amounts of money for the rich,

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
and I got paid a lot of money.

122
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,440
And then I can pay people to work for me.

123
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,880
In a sense,

124
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,320
you're kind of recreating this kind of feudal system

125
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
with the rich own everything,

126
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,160
and they pay a group below them to manage stuff

127
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
for them, who pay a group

128
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,840
below them to manage stuff for them.

129
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,440
But it all comes down basically to the same point

130
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,600
that passive income is about who owns the resources.

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,320
Which brings us to the question of is it possible

132
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
for everyone to get a passive income?

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
Well, in a sense, yes,

134
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,680
because these resources really exist.

135
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,400
So there are some kinds of passive incomes

136
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,240
which are inherently zero sum in society.

137
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,560
So for example, debt and debt interest.

138
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,240
This is about who is in debt and who's in credit.

139
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,480
It's payment from one person to another.

140
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,160
But these resources they do really exist.

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,360
You know,

142
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,520
there is an enormous amount of productive capital.

143
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,400
You know, there's a massive stock

144
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
market out there which you could own some of.

145
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,200
And they're all of these buildings and properties

146
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,600
which you could own somehow. So

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,960
I think in reality,

148
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,240
the thing to realise is we live in a very rich country,

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,360
in a very rich world with a lot of real resources,

150
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,640
and you could own some of that.

151
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,240
I think people sometimes see me

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
calling for taxation of the rich

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,320
and think that I'm

154
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
some kind of communist,

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,400
but what I want is for you to own your own house

156
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,120
without a massive mortgage.

157
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,280
And also I want you to own

158
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
a big chunk of the stock market.

159
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,040
I want you to own

160
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,560
a big chunk of the farmland or the natural resources.

161
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,760
I want you,

162
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,720
the ordinary

163
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,280
working people of this country, Britain or whatever

164
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,840
country you’re in, to own the wealth of your country.

165
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,320
And if you do that,

166
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
then we can all have a passive income.

167
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,600
We can all live lives like, you know,

168
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,200
I am somebody who has a lot of wealth

169
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,080
and I live off my passive income.

170
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
And if I chose to stop working, I could stop working.

171
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,560
I could live off of that.

172
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
If we all had the passive income,

173
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
then we wouldn't have to work so hard

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,680
because we own the properties we're in and we’d

175
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,280
own some of the wealth of our countries.

176
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,840
And we’d live relatively comfortable lives.

177
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,480
But if you look at what's actually happening

178
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,280
to the ownership of wealth,

179
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,080
it's aggressively

180
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
being sucked away from the middle class.

181
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
You can see that in terms

182
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
of reduced homeownership rates,

183
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
much higher levels of mortgage debt,

184
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
it's being pulled away from the government.

185
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,440
You can see that in terms of government

186
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
loss of assets, privatisation of government assets

187
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
and the government falling into debt,

188
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
and it's being held by the very rich.

189
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,080
What that means is

190
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,200
you're losing a wealth, government's losing a wealth,

191
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,440
and you are losing your passive income,

192
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
and you end up in kind of this situation

193
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
of the opposite of passive income,

194
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,360
which is not only do you not have a passive

195
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,200
income and ownership of the stock market,

196
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,320
you don't even own enough

197
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,400
to live in a house and to eat food.

198
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,520
You end up in a kind of

199
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,560
passive slavery as you will,

200
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,440
which is you don't own anything

201
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
and you need to work your tits off

202
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
just to live in a house and eat food.

203
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,520
So, passive income, it could be great.

204
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,600
You know, we could all own

205
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,480
a fair share of the country we live in,

206
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,720
and we could all live nice, comfortable lives where we

207
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
generate money just for getting out of bed

208
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,480
like Rishi Sunak does.

209
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,640
And I'm not saying we could all stop working,

210
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,120
but we could live much more comfortable lives.

211
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,760
And the only way that would happen

212
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,400
is if you own the wealth.

213
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
But the direction of travel, of wealth

214
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
is away from you and towards the rich,

215
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
which means not only will

216
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,160
you not have a passive income,

217
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,760
you will not have wealth.

218
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,240
You will not even be able to,

219
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,880
in many cases afford food, housing and energy.

220
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,840
So the end message is passive

221
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,960
income is about wealth distribution.

222
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
Passive income is about who owns the wealth.

223
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,360
Do you own it or do the rich own it?

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
If we get wealth into the hands of ordinary people,

225
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
you can live a very comfortable life

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
just like the rich do now.

227
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
If we push wealth in the other direction,

228
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,240
like we are doing,

229
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,920
then increasingly ordinary people will struggle

230
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,400
to feed their kids and turn the heating on.

231
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,040
So passive income, it's great.

232
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,400
The only way to do it is to get wealth into your hands.

233
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,480
The only way to get wealth into your hands

234
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,640
is to significantly increase taxation on the rich,

235
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,720
because they've got it,

236
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,920
and they're not going to give it to you any other way.

237
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
So passive income, let's get it.

238
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,480
Let's take the wealth back.

239
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Let's live in a more equal country

240
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
where people can live good lives.

241
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm going to push through it on this channel.

242
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
Keep supporting.

243
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Tell your friends, tell your mum. Take care.
