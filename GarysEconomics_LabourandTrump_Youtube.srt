1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,040
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,520
Today we are going to talk about

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,400
why Labour and Trump will both fail.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,840
Okay.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,560
So we are in a situation now

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,880
where we have new governments

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,920
in both the UK and the US.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,360
And on the face of it, you have two very different

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,160
political parties, two very different leaders.

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,240
We have one

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,960
center left party, one right

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,880
wing party with a very right wing leader,

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,360
and they both have very different

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,560
sets of economic policies.

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
What we're going to explain today

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,120
is how both of these parties, despite

17
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,240
having very different sets of policies, will fail.

18
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,200
And we're going to talk about what

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,600
that teaches us about economics

20
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,840
and the left and the right of politics today.

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,920
So I think it's important to recognise

22
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,680
that both of these governments have come into power

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,680
at a situation where the economy has weakened a lot.

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,120
There have been significant falls in living standards,

25
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,760
and there has been a real significant loss of faith

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
from the general public in the economic status

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
quo and politics in general.

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,720
This means that both of these parties,

29
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,680
both of these leaders, have come into power

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,800
needing to offer something new, a kind of new idea

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,280
on economics and a new idea on politics.

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
And what we can learn from

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,520
these two parties is basically

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,760
what the main new pitches are,

35
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,200
and where the economy needs to go.

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,120
Okay, let's start with Labour.

37
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,640
Now, the Labour economic policy,

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,480
I think of it as a kind of managed centrism

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,640
or a managed sensible-ism.

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,560
And when I say sensible-ism,

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,640
I don't mean to say that I think it is actually

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,080
a good or a sensible policy.

43
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,800
In reality,

44
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,920
I think Labour’s economic policy will fail quite badly.

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,640
I think it will lead to significantly

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,200
falling living standards.

47
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,680
But I call it a sensible-ism

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
because it's important to understand

49
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,160
that it is basically rooted in

50
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,680
what is kind of considered

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,240
the sensible economic policy

52
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,280
of mainstream modern economists.

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,240
Economists love this kind of policy,

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,120
but also the way that it’s implemented

55
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,400
and the way that it's presented

56
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,680
seems to be really rooted in this idea that Labour,

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,920
and Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves view themselves

58
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,360
as extremely sensible economically.

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
So let's talk about what the actual policy is.

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,800
So this managed sensible-ism

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,960
is basically the idea that you do

62
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,720
everything but a little bit more of it.

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
So you borrow a bit more,

64
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,360
you tax a bit more,

65
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,600
you spend a bit more and crucially,

66
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,760
you use that money to invest a little bit more.

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,240
So I think you can already see how sensible-ism

68
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,960
is, like a very key part of how this idea views itself.

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
And this managed sensible-ism

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
is rooted

71
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,240
in this idea that has been popular

72
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,960
amongst economists for a long time,

73
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,440
that there is a productivity puzzle

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,240
or a productivity problem

75
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,240
in Western economies, but in particular the UK economy.

76
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,360
I might do a video specifically about that puzzle

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,880
because I think it's kind of nonsense.

78
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,800
But to make it clear,

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,040
this basically comes down to the UK economy,

80
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,160
like a lot of Western economies,

81
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,040
but in particular the UK economy has really not grown

82
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,840
very much for a long time.

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
And economists

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,000
and the Labour Party

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,040
basically say, you want to grow more,

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,240
what you need is to invest more.

87
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,080
So our plan is to borrow a bit more, tax a bit more,

88
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,680
use that money to invest,

89
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,360
and we're going to grow the economy.

90
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,040
And this kind of ties into the idea

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,600
that we've had a conservative government for 14 years.

92
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,120
They were largely an austerity government.

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,760
They tried to save a lot of money.

94
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,120
They didn't really invest in the country.

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,440
So there's this idea going around

96
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,560
that we have crumbling infrastructure.

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,520
So we need to raise a bit of money

98
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,880
and use that money to invest

99
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,520
in growing our infrastructure.

100
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,280
So this policy, it sounds really sensible, right.

101
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,720
We're going to raise a little bit of money.

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,760
We're going to invest.

103
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,800
Investment is great.

104
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,440
Economists love investment.

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
We're going to grow, we're going to grow the economy.

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,880
And we're going to fix all of our problems this way.

107
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,880
So if it's so great sounding, if it's so sensible,

108
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,200
why is it going to fail?

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,800
Well, I think the first and most obvious way

110
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,240
that we can see

111
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,160
this policy is probably going to fail is because

112
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,440
America, and in fact recently Germany,

113
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,800
already tried it.

114
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,320
They already tried this policy and did it work?

115
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,880
Did it work in those countries.

116
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,280
So obviously in the US,

117
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,400
we had the Democrats under Joe Biden in power

118
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,640
for the last four years,

119
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,320
and they basically went pretty aggressively

120
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,920
into this kind of policy.

121
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,480
In particular they borrowed a lot of money,

122
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,560
they spent a lot of money,

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,760
and they tried to do a lot of investment.

124
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,080
Did it work?

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,400
On the one hand,

126
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
the US has had higher levels of GDP growth,

127
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,880
much higher than the UK,

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
significantly higher than most Western countries

129
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,200
in the last four years.

130
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
In the...

131
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,880
On the other hand,

132
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
they got pretty badly beaten in the election,

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
which gives a good sense

134
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
that the general public is not happy

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
with the policy or with the government.

136
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,560
This kind of raises like an interesting question.

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,800
There's

138
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,760
this idea that has been going around,

139
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
in particular in the American media

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,960
a lot in the last couple of years.

141
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,720
There's a phrase which is the vibes are off.

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,520
I don't think I've spoken

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
about this phrase on the channel.

144
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,800
I kind of love this phrase

145
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
because it tells you kind of everything

146
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,480
about modern economics today.

147
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,360
So the vibes are off.

148
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
Is an idea popular

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,920
in American economics, the economic press,

150
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,840
which is that

151
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,920
the economy is actually really, really strong.

152
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,280
And because of the strength of the economy,

153
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,960
it doesn't make any sense

154
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,120
that the public are so unhappy.

155
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,320
And the actual problem is just that

156
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,880
the public is somehow picking up on

157
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,720
some, like, negative vibes.

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,120
And the reason for this is something

159
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,360
which I speak about a lot on this channel, which is

160
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,480
economists,

161
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,440
they love to look at these kind of big

162
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
macro aggregate measures of the economy.

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,120
So in the last few years,

164
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,480
GDP growth has been quite good in the US.

165
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,160
Unemployment has been quite low

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,040
and inflation has been falling.

167
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,080
So from the perspective of an economist,

168
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,040
they're looking at this

169
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,200
and they're saying oh the economy's good.

170
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,760
The economy is good.

171
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,800
What you need to understand is most economists,

172
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,840
especially most influential

173
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,800
economists,

174
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,520
are rich people from rich families

175
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,000
with elite degrees and well-paid jobs.

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,280
So what these guys are seeing

177
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400
is, you know,

178
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
good top level numbers,

179
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,680
GDP growth, inflation, unemployment,

180
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,320
they themselves, their personal financial position,

181
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,000
their family's financial position, their community’s

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
financial position is doing really well.

183
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
And they don't really see the fact

184
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,040
that increasingly in the last three,

185
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,120
four years,

186
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,800
your average American,

187
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,200
just like your average English or British person,

188
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,480
is increasingly struggling

189
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,280
to pay the rent, pay the bills,

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,040
in many cases even pay for things

191
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,200
like food and heating.

192
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
And this basically

193
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,600
is the same problem

194
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,840
that I talk about a lot on this channel.

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,280
Economists just look at the big picture numbers.

196
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,920
They themselves are rich.

197
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,080
They don't see that as inequality rises quickly,

198
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,920
it is possible for the rich to do very well,

199
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,760
whilst the poor

200
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,680
fall deeper and deeper and deeper into poverty.

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
And Labour are making this exact

202
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,640
same mistake, basically.

203
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,160
They will focus exclusively on the economy

204
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,240
and growth, GDP,

205
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,240
all of these large big picture numbers.

206
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,960
But we are sitting here in 2025

207
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,920
just after Covid,

208
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,240
which saw an absolutely unbelievable,

209
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
enormous increase in wealth inequality.

210
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,320
If you don't deal with that, then living standards

211
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
will continue to fall for the poor

212
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
and for ordinary people.

213
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
You simply have to deal

214
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,520
with the growing inequality of wealth.

215
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,760
You know,

216
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,920
living standards were falling for ordinary people

217
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,520
even before Covid

218
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,480
because they were increasingly unable

219
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,360
to compete with the rich for resources.

220
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,320
Since Covid, inequality is much worse.

221
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,240
This is what I've made my money on.

222
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
This is what I made my history on.

223
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,880
The situation is much worse now.

224
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,200
If Labour don't look at it,

225
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,320
they will make the exact same mistake that Biden made,

226
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,240
that the Democrats made,

227
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,200
which is essentially

228
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,440
you are in a situation now

229
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,600
where the rich are much, much, much richer.

230
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
They are sucking wealth out

231
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,760
like a black hole of the middle class

232
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,680
and the government extremely quickly.

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,400
This will lead to falling living standards.

234
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,320
The second thing to say is that,

235
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,360
you know, there is a kind of a naive assumption here

236
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,320
that the government can simply invest.

237
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,200
And you see this idea often in media coverage

238
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
that says the government should just build houses,

239
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,840
the government should just build houses.

240
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,560
The resources which your government needs to invest,

241
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
the resources

242
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,040
which your government needs to build houses,

243
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,120
are already owned by rich people.

244
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,880
You cannot build those houses,

245
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,760
you cannot make those investments

246
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,440
unless you get those resources.

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,520
Now we have a government here in the UK,

248
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,720
which is unfortunately very, very resistant

249
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
to the taxation of rich people,

250
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,280
which means their whole plan

251
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,040
is to either borrow from the rich,

252
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
which, as we saw last month,

253
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,080
could potentially be very, very difficult,

254
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
or to raise taxes on you.

255
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,720
So the government has raised taxes slightly,

256
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,960
but the main tax they raised

257
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,040
was tax National insurance,

258
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,880
which is a tax on working people.

259
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
They haven't done really anything at all

260
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,920
significantly to raise taxes on the rich.

261
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
So what you see here is a government

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,760
that is faced with a massive,

263
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,400
massive increase

264
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,160
in inequality, a massive, massive loss of resources

265
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,120
for working people, for the government,

266
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,520
and rather than addressing

267
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,240
tax policy

268
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
to get the resources back,

269
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,200
they're trying to borrow it back, which in many cases

270
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,360
it looks like they possibly can't do,

271
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,640
and they're taxing you instead.

272
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,160
The UK government is in a

273
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,960
much weaker position than the US government

274
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,040
when it comes to borrowing.

275
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,280
This means that they are not able

276
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,800
to do the same amount of borrowing,

277
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,480
investing that Joe Biden did,

278
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
and even that led to him

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,840
really significantly losing the next election.

280
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,200
So essentially, Labour are extremely blind

281
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,560
to the problem of inequality and distribution,

282
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,800
and they are kind of rehashing a policy

283
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,400
that they've already seen fail in America,

284
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,720
only they're doing it with much, much less money.

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,480
Unfortunately, this will fail.

286
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,440
Okay, now on to Donald Trump.

287
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,360
The first thing I want to say

288
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,960
is, it's

289
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,840
actually not easy to know

290
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,480
exactly what Donald Trump will do

291
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
when it comes to the economy.

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
For the reason that I explained in my recent video,

293
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,800
Truth, Lies & Gains,

294
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,840
which is basically that

295
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,160
what Donald Trump says he is going to do is often not

296
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,800
particularly connected to what Donald Trump wants to do

297
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,840
or what Donald Trump intends to do.

298
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,200
But obviously,

299
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,280
we should look at and consider

300
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,080
and talk about the two economic policies

301
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,680
which he speaks about most,

302
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,160
which are tariffs and reducing immigration.

303
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,680
Now, both of these policies are really popular

304
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,520
because they sound very America first.

305
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,440
Now, we’re obviously living in a time

306
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
when the economy is very weak for ordinary people.

307
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,240
People are worried,

308
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,000
people are scared,

309
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,080
and people want their leaders to protect them.

310
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
And for that reason,

311
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,040
these kind of anti-immigration policies

312
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,600
are increasingly very popular all over the world

313
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,240
because they make people feel like at last,

314
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,000
our leaders are coming here to protect me,

315
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
our leaders are coming here to protect us.

316
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,960
They're not worrying about foreigners.

317
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,200
How do I know it's not going to work on the economy?

318
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,520
Well, we can do a similar thing here

319
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,800
to what we just did when analysing Labour.

320
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,240
So when Labour came in, they’re

321
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,440
kind of replicating the economic plans of

322
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
the American government that were going out,

323
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,840
and Trump is doing a similar thing

324
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,360
with regards to his rhetoric on immigration,

325
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,840
that the Conservative government did for a long time.

326
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,800
So the Conservative government really,

327
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,000
really aggressively spoke

328
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,560
about wanting to reduce immigration.

329
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
They made it kind of one of their flagship policies.

330
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,840
They leant really heavily into Brexit,

331
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,280
which was, of course, to a significant...

332
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,760
to a significant degree about reducing immigration.

333
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,000
And yet when they came in,

334
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,560
they actually didn't reduce immigration at all.

335
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,840
In fact, they significantly increased immigration.

336
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,400
So why does this happen?

337
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,760
You know,

338
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,800
I think it's pretty clear to see why this happens.

339
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,480
This is a very popular rhetoric.

340
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,800
It's very,

341
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
very popular to say we're going to reduce immigration.

342
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,640
Lots of people want immigration to be reduced.

343
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,600
But when the Conservatives actually come into power,

344
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,160
you know,

345
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,720
I’d love to have them on, if you want to discuss it,

346
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
but I think what happens is you sit down,

347
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
you look at it and you realise

348
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,640
actually some pretty important sections of our economy

349
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,720
have basically

350
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
been built

351
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,960
at this point to be extremely dependent on immigration.

352
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,440
So in the UK you have three sectors of the economy

353
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
which are like really, really,

354
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,720
really extremely depend on immigration,

355
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
which are the NHS,

356
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
care for elderly people and the universities.

357
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
And all of these sectors

358
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,880
are basically completely depends

359
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,160
on immigrants at the moment.

360
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,960
So I think the Conservatives come in,

361
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,760
they kind of sell,

362
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
we've really, really sold ourselves

363
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,040
on reducing immigration.

364
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,560
We've done Brexit,

365
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,080
but actually

366
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,480
these three really important sectors of the economy

367
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,200
basically won't work if we reduce immigration.

368
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,160
So then they end up in this kind of situation

369
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,320
where they need to play this game of really,

370
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
really, really aggressively

371
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
acting like and saying they want to reduce immigration

372
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
whilst not actually reducing immigration

373
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,400
because it would damage these sectors of the economy.

374
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,720
I don't want to say you can't reduce immigration,

375
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,360
but you need to be really careful

376
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,600
and strategic about how you do it.

377
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,320
So in the US,

378
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,040
there are also a lot of sectors of the economy

379
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,600
which have become very dependent on migrant labour.

380
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,920
I think in the US it's

381
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,360
things like agriculture, a lot of...

382
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,160
a lot of low paid work,

383
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,680
and you could reduce immigration and try and replace

384
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
these workers with domestic workers.

385
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
But you need to do the prep work

386
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
beforehand to make sure

387
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,400
that you have the workers available.

388
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,840
And I'm not sure Donald Trump has done that prep work.

389
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,400
I think he's going to find himself in a very,

390
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,520
very similar situation to the Conservatives, basically.

391
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,440
Where he finds that

392
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,760
what you need to say to get into power

393
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,720
is very, very difficult

394
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,520
to what you need to do to keep the economy running.

395
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,720
And he is probably going to be forced

396
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,880
into a similar situation

397
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,760
of talking very hard on immigration,

398
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,480
whilst not actually doing a lot on it,

399
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,600
because he hasn't done the prep work

400
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
to make sure that the workers are there

401
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,120
for the sectors

402
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,000
that have become dependent on these workers.

403
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,200
And tariffs are essentially the same thing.

404
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,480
You know,

405
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,760
I think tariffs are actually potentially

406
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,720
an interesting policy.

407
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,200
And if you

408
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,160
go back through history,

409
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,440
you will see that a lot of countries

410
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,440
have had a lot of success in the past with tariffs.

411
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,720
Countries like Japan and South Korea

412
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,280
and Taiwan successfully built themselves up

413
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,320
in the 20th century

414
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,960
by using tariffs to protect certain industries.

415
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,320
Even countries like the UK

416
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,000
and the US themselves have used tariffs

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,600
a lot at points in their history.

418
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,880
And when you live in a world where you are competing

419
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,080
with extremely unequal countries

420
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
like China, like India,

421
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,520
China is still much more unequal than the West,

422
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,040
that have much lower levels of wages.

423
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,280
Tariffs can be used to protect your domestic economy,

424
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,480
to protect your domestic worker.

425
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,440
But again, you have

426
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,760
just like with immigration, you have this problem.

427
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,480
Do we have the industries

428
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,800
ready here

429
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,880
to produce the products which we're going to lose

430
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,360
when we bring the tariffs in?

431
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,080
And I think tariffs can work

432
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,560
when they are targeted at specific industries

433
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,520
where you are being outcompeted by

434
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,440
foreign companies with cheaper labour.

435
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,720
I don't think they work when they're applied

436
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,880
really broadly to basically everything.

437
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
If you apply them across the board,

438
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,840
even in spaces

439
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,440
where you don't have the domestic industry

440
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,480
available to replace those tariffed imports,

441
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,360
all you end up doing is really increasing prices,

442
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,840
really increasing costs.

443
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,800
This ends up hitting the poorest the most

444
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,920
because they spend a much

445
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,120
higher percentage of their money

446
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,560
on basic goods and services.

447
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,120
And it would actually really,

448
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,280
if it was not targeted,

449
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,320
and if it was not carefully done,

450
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
it would really, really,

451
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,800
actually hurt living standards.

452
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
So I think Trump is going to find himself

453
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,480
basically just like the Conservatives

454
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
in this situation

455
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,760
where he knows that

456
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,520
these policies, he's shouted loudly for,

457
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,160
reducing immigration, increasing tariffs, are basically

458
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,880
not really workable from an economic perspective,

459
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,280
and he will have to constantly back down

460
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
from them in certain ways.

461
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,760
And I suspect in the end,

462
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,080
he probably won't go through with really implementing

463
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,520
either of these policies in a very...

464
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,560
in the kind of large scale he's promised.

465
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,320
But if he's simply not going to do the policies

466
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,080
which he says he's going to do,

467
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,320
how can I say the economy will fail?

468
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,760
The answer is, quite simply, tax policy.

469
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,040
There is one area

470
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
where I think I can confidently predict

471
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
what Trump will do,

472
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,480
because he did it last time

473
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,640
and he looks convinced to do it again.

474
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,960
And it's very in the interests

475
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,040
of both himself and Elon Musk,

476
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,080
who appears to be backing him financially.

477
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,040
He will significantly reduce taxes on rich people,

478
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,920
and he will fund that probably by

479
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,120
slashing government spending in some cases,

480
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,040
which will often cause

481
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,400
a lot people to lose their jobs, cause

482
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,920
a lot of people to lose support.

483
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,520
And he will fund it by raising taxes

484
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,720
on ordinary working people.

485
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Let's assume even if he

486
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,880
didn't raise taxes on working people.

487
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,200
Is it a problem if Donald Trump massively

488
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
slashes taxes on rich people?

489
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,040
How does that affect ordinary

490
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,440
people's living standards?

491
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Okay, I've said this a million times on the channel,

492
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,240
but I am going to go through it

493
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,560
really clearly for you again,

494
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,120
because it is really, really important

495
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,480
when you are considering Donald Trump's policy

496
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
to slash taxes on the rich.

497
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,040
When rich people get an enormous amount of money

498
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
that is bad for you,

499
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,040
that is bad for your living standards,

500
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,520
I'll explain why.

501
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,640
Money is not a real resource, okay? Money is not food.

502
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,880
Money is not housing.

503
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,280
Money is a competitive resource.

504
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,440
Money is a distributional resource.

505
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,560
Money is the resource that we use to determine

506
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,560
the allocation of the real resources.

507
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,960
If rich people get an enormous amount of money,

508
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,200
they will use that money to buy the things you need.

509
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,080
They will outcompete you and your children for housing.

510
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,480
House prices will go up.

511
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,120
Your kids will not be able to afford a house.

512
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,880
That means they will rent for longer.

513
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,200
That means they will have to borrow money

514
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
from the rich to buy houses,

515
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,600
they will pay more interest, okay.

516
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
Once the rich have more assets,

517
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
inequality will be higher

518
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,560
and they will start to use more of the consumption

519
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:15,880
goods.

520
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,920
They will use more land, they will use more food,

521
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,880
they will use more energy,

522
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
they will use more goods and services.

523
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
And you will get less of these things.

524
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,400
Listen, I know inequality...

525
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,480
I know economists don't talk about inequality much.

526
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,360
That's the reason why I am a multi-millionaire.

527
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,120
And most economists are not because I made my money

528
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,720
by understanding that inequality hurts the economy.

529
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,840
If you've not watched it yet

530
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,520
and you don't understand the argument

531
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,760
I've been making for a long time,

532
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,720
that inequality hurts your living standards,

533
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,760
I really recommend

534
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,240
you watch the first video on this channel.

535
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,840
I opened this channel

536
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,000
because I saw at the beginning of Covid

537
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,520
that governments were going to give out

538
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,000
enormous amounts of money.

539
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
That money would go to the rich,

540
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,360
and that would cause a collapse

541
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,400
in your living standards. That has happened.

542
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,200
I predicted that in June 2020

543
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
because I understand

544
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,920
that inequality affects living standards.

545
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Of course, the distribution affects living standards.

546
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,800
Donald Trump

547
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,080
will oversee a massive cut in the tax of rich people,

548
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
and that will make your living standards worse.

549
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,840
That is how I know

550
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,800
that Donald Trump will fail in the economy

551
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,560
for the same reason I know

552
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,720
that Keir Starmer and Labour will fail in the economy.

553
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,600
Because both of these governments,

554
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,720
both of these leaders, despite in theory

555
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,800
sitting on opposite

556
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,480
sides of the political spectrum,

557
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,040
will oversee a continued increase in inequality,

558
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,160
which will lead to a continued decrease

559
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
in living standards,

560
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,680
just like Obama did,

561
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,440
just like David

562
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,720
Cameron did, just like Boris Johnson did,

563
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,040
just like George Bush did

564
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,440
all of these presidents

565
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,240
and prime ministers, be they red or blue,

566
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,400
all of your leaders

567
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,240
have overseen a rise in inequality,

568
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
and that is why your living standards are falling.

569
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,840
And that is why your kids

570
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,560
and your grandkids will be poor.

571
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,280
The message that I want to give here

572
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,160
is stop worrying about all of this

573
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,560
red blue, red blue bull***t, okay?

574
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,320
It's red blue, red blue, red, blue.

575
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,040
And every single time

576
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,960
you get poorer and your kids get poorer,

577
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,160
and the politicians

578
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,840
and the wealthy people who fund them

579
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,800
get richer and richer and richer and richer.

580
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Stop arguing about the right left

581
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,880
bull***t and start protecting your resources.

582
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,040
Start protecting your wealth.

583
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,120
Follow the money.

584
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,240
Follow the money.

585
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,720
Who is getting richer? Who is getting poorer?

586
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,160
Whose taxes are going up?

587
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,600
Whose taxes are going down?

588
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,760
Who is finding it harder to buy a house?

589
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,000
Who is buying 10 or 20 houses?

590
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,160
Follow the money. Look at the distribution.

591
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,160
This is what matters to protect

592
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,480
the financial position of your kids and your grandkids.

593
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,000
Listen, you are losing your wealth.

594
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,600
What you have

595
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,640
here is a massive boat with a hole in the bottom,

596
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
and one group of people

597
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,600
is telling you to row more sensibly

598
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
and another group is telling you

599
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,920
to kick out the foreigners

600
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,640
while you and your family

601
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,200
and your community are hemorrhaging your wealth

602
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,680
to those people and the people that fund them,

603
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,200
you're bleeding to death here.

604
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,120
Donald Trump is an extremely wealthy

605
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,240
man, funded by the richest man in the world.

606
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,920
Keir Starmer is a rich man

607
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,640
funded by a very wealthy man.

608
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,800
These guys are getting richer, okay.

609
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,920
It’s you guys who are getting poorer.

610
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,600
You need to protect your position.

611
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,800
I want to end this by addressing a question

612
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,440
that I've gotten a lot in the last couple of weeks.

613
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,560
I spent the last couple of weeks

614
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,960
traveling up and down the UK a couple of times,

615
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,480
talking to groups of people all around the country.

616
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,720
And a lot of people asked me,

617
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,800
if you were Chancellor, what would you do?

618
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,040
And when I hear that,

619
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,480
what I

620
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
hear is people who are worried about what is happening

621
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,280
and they want me to fix this quickly.

622
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,160
I want to make this clear to you,

623
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,240
we're not going to fix this quickly.

624
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,280
It's not that easy. It's not going to be easy.

625
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,960
The richest

626
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,200
and most powerful people

627
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,960
in my country, in your country, wherever you are,

628
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
are going to try and stop this, okay?

629
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,200
They are getting richer from it.

630
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
The politicians,

631
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,840
the economists,

632
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,440
they are getting richer year after year.

633
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,920
They're going to attack me, they’re

634
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,400
going to attack the things that I'm saying.

635
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,640
Even if I was to get into power,

636
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,480
these guys would try and lobby

637
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,920
to put holes in the rules.

638
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,600
They would try and get the newspapers

639
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,200
to say it was nonsense.

640
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,440
They try and stop it. It's not going to be easy.

641
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,320
It's not going to be easy.

642
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
Look, your grandparents

643
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,160
and your great grandparents lived in poverty

644
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,800
and they fought for generations

645
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,880
and generations and generations.

646
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,680
And that is the reason why

647
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,520
you don't have to live

648
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,760
in the kind of poverty that they lived in.

649
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,000
Because they came back from the war

650
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,680
and they demanded food,

651
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,920
housing, education, health care.

652
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,240
And they got it, and they got it by taxing the rich.

653
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,480
They understood that

654
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,160
the only way to protect working

655
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,040
people was to tax work less and wealth more.

656
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,800
You need to fight that same fight.

657
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,080
There's a quote by the old politician,

658
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,680
British politician Tony Benn that I like,

659
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,640
he said, there’s no final victory

660
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,720
and there's no final defeat.

661
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,880
There's only the same fight to be fought again

662
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,680
and again and again.

663
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,240
So toughen up.

664
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,520
Listen,

665
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,280
I don't do this work because I think I'm going to win.

666
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,880
And I don't do this work because I think it's easy.

667
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,320
I do it because I know if we don't fight this fight,

668
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,760
if you don't fight this fight,

669
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,000
this economic situation gets worse

670
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,680
and worse and worse and worse.

671
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,120
But we've done it before.

672
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,000
Your grandparents,

673
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
your great grandparents did it before.

674
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,680
They demanded that

675
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,760
instead of the rich getting richer and richer,

676
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,480
every generation, wealth

677
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,320
flowed back to the working classes.

678
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,880
And they recognised you do that by taxing the rich.

679
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,120
Listen, the government in my country,

680
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,760
the government in your country is going to fail.

681
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,320
The only people who can protect

682
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,680
ordinary working people is you.

683
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
You can do this.

684
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,240
You have to do this.

685
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,760
One last thing.

686
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,640
If you're wondering

687
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,600
why there's a bouquet of flowers over my shoulder.

688
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,440
That's from Penguin, the publishing corporation,

689
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,680
for the book being number one.

690
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,640
Thanks for your support.

691
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,840
You can do this. We can do this. Good luck.
