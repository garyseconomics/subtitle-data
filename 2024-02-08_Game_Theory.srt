00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,360
Today, we are going to teach you some game theory.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,520
Learning about game theory can teach us a lot about,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,120
number one, how modern economists think.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,600
And number two,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,400
I've been thinking about it a lot recently

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,440
with regards to

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,120
difficulties I've been having and difficulties

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,320
I think we are going to have

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
with regards to fixing our economic system.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,800
So we're going to go through that today.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,760
Okay, so first,

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,440
a very quick introduction of what game theory is.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,480
So game theory is a very popular field of economics.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,400
Well,

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,640
it's a field of mathematics, really,

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
which is popular nowadays in economics,

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,920
where you

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,200
basically turn real life situations into gains.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,880
You say there's a certain number of players,

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,040
maybe you and me, a two player game.

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,280
We make moves,

23
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,440
we play against each other and we get outcomes.

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,400
And through game theory,

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,440
we can analyse what you're going to do,

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
what I'm going to do,

27
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,000
what you should do,

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,800
what I should do,

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,520
and hopefully we play the game better.

30
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
What I'm going to do today

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,880
is I'm going to explain to you the simplest

32
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,920
and probably most famous game in game theory,

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,560
which is called The Prisoner's Dilemma.

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, this is a super popular game

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,720
and it's been used by a lot of economists

36
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,600
to basically defend the idea that

37
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,440
people are selfish.

38
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,440
And the best way to understand is to explain the game.

39
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,360
Okay, so in The Prisoner's Dilemma,

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,080
you've got two prisoner's

41
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,040
they've been arrested for doing something wrong.

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
It could be anything.

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,760
Let's assume they've been arrested

44
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,720
for running a YouTube channel

45
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,320
that says the government is full of idiots

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,400
and the police are sitting

47
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,840
these two prisoners down in separate rooms,

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
and they've got a little bit of evidence

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,960
on both of these prisoners,

50
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,920
but not enough to really,

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,360
really hit them, put them in prison for a long time.

52
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,560
So what they're trying to do is, they're trying to

53
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,200
get both of the prisoners

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,920
to grass on each other,

55
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,440
to give information on one another.

56
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,800
And the way they do that is they say,

57
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,600
listen, if you grass on

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,880
your friend, the other prisoner,

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,640
then we’ll reduce your prison time.

60
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,240
And the way that they set this game up is like this.

61
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,280
Okay, so there's two players in this game.

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,360
Let's assume it's you and me.

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,480
So

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,400
you and me

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,400
and basically we only have...

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,760
It's a very, very simple game.

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,520
We only have one choice to make each,

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,160
which is whether or not we grass on each other.

69
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,680
And that means

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,800
there are four possible outcomes in this game,

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,160
which is

72
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,640
either we both grass

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,080
or we both stay silent

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,320
or you grass and I stay silent or I grass

75
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,720
and you stay silent.

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,000
So I'm drawing out a diagram here,

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
which basically covers

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,080
all the four situations in the game,

79
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,280
and we can view it as basically a move from you.

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,920
So in this diagram,

81
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,160
your two options are listed here on the top.

82
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,080
Grass on the left, stay silent on the right.

83
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,520
My two options are listed down the side.

84
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,440
Grass on the top, stay silent on the bottom.

85
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,040
So this covers all the four situations.

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,240
And the police have set it up

87
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,040
so that they want you to grass.

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,880
So they say to you, if you grass

89
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,280
and your friend doesn't grass,

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,760
So I don’t grass, we’ll

91
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,120
let you go away completely free

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
and we'll send your friend to jail for ten years.

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,840
So this is the situation here where you grass

94
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,160
and I stay silent. So it's this bottom left situation.

95
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,920
And in that case

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,080
they give you zero years and they give me ten years

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,800
and they make the same offer to me.

98
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,720
So if I grass and you stay silent, you'll get ten years

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,800
and I'll get zero years.

100
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,040
If we both stay silent, then they don't have much

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,280
evidence on us at all.

102
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,520
So they can only give us one year each.

103
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,880
So that's this bottom right corner.

104
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,480
We both stay silent. You one year, me one year.

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
If we both grass,

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,560
then they've got a lot of evidence on both of us

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,920
and they'll put us both in jail for five years.

108
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,160
That's this top left corner, we both grass.

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,520
Okay, so now we've got the basic set-up of the game.

110
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
We can start to analyse it

111
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
from a game theory perspective.

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,960
And what game theory will tell us to do is

113
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,280
consider your situation.

114
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,760
Now, you could be in one of two situations.

115
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,320
Situation number one is I'm grassing on you.

116
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,280
And situation number two is I'm silent

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,840
and I'm not grassing on you.

118
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,720
So you analyse what you should do in both situations.

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
Now consider I'm grassing on you.

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,400
Now you have a choice.

121
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,120
Either you grass on me and you get five years

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,760
or you don't grass on me and you get ten years.

123
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
So what game theory will say is, now

124
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,720
we've really simplified this game.

125
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
If Gary grasses on you,

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
your choice is five years

127
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,040
in prison or ten years in prison.

128
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,520
Obviously, five years is better,

129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,200
so if I grass on you, you should grass.

130
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,120
That's your strategy.

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,080
If Gary grasses, you should grass.

132
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
Now situation number two.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,680
What if Gary stays silent. Well now you have a choice.

134
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
Either you grass on me

135
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,800
and you get zero years in prison, you get to go free

136
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,280
or you don't grass on me

137
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,960
and you get one year in prison.

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,280
Now you have a choice.

139
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Zero years in prison or one year in prison.

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,160
Zero years in prison

141
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,640
is obviously better than one year in prison.

142
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,160
So again, you should grass.

143
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,080
So in both situations, whether I grass on you

144
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,120
or I don't grass on you,

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,600
you should grass on me

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,160
because you will get less time in prison.

147
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
So that means we have

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,560
what game theorists would call a dominant strategy.

149
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,440
Whatever I do, you should grass on me.

150
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,280
Grassing on me is

151
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,280
the best outcome for you, regardless of my action.

152
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,040
So according to economists, game theorists,

153
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,120
you should definitely grass on me,

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
that is your dominant strategy.

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,080
Now, of course, this game is totally symmetrical,

156
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,320
so if we analyse the game from my perspective,

157
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,240
it will be exactly the same analysis

158
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,840
as what we just went through now.

159
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,320
So that means obviously

160
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,840
I also have a dominant strategy.

161
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,200
Whatever you do, I should grass on you.

162
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,440
And whatever I do, you should grass on me.

163
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,320
This means that we have what in game theory

164
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
they call a Nash equilibrium,

165
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
which is named after the insane

166
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,320
mathematician John Nash.

167
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,600
Which means, I definitely know what I'm going to do

168
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,040
because I'm going to grass on you whatever.

169
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,480
You definitely know what you're going to do.

170
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
You're going to grass on me or whatever.

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,280
So we will both definitely grass on each other.

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,320
I can't change what you do.

173
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,520
You can't change what I do. It's a stable equilibrium.

174
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,200
We will both grass and each other.

175
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,080
We will end up here in the top left box

176
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,520
where we both get five years in prison.

177
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,960
Now, what's interesting about

178
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,080
this game is there's another box.

179
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
This bottom right corner

180
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
where if we both stay silent.,

181
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
it would have been better for both of us.

182
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
I would have got one year, you would have got one year.

183
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,080
As it is, we're both grassing, we’re

184
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,960
both getting five years.

185
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,800
So we've ended up in a pretty bad situation.

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,960
So it's interesting, right?

187
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,920
Why does it happen

188
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,760
that we end up in this bad situation?

189
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,800
Why can't we just both not grass

190
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,320
and be in a better situation?

191
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,320
The reason for that is we've done the analysis.

192
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,440
If I know you're not grassing,

193
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,400
it's better for me to grass.

194
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,320
So I'm going to grass anyway

195
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,680
and you're in the same situation.

196
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,200
If you know I'm not grassing, you're going to grass.

197
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
So basically we can't trust each other

198
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,960
because we're both selfish.,

199
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
we're both going to grass off

200
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,600
and the end result is we're going to get a bad outcome

201
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,000
for both of us. Now, this is

202
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
the most famous game in game theory,

203
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,760
and it's often used by game theorists, micro economists

204
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,600
to basically justify the idea that people are selfish

205
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
and that basically f*cks us up because we're selfish.

206
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
But there's nothing you can do about it

207
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,560
because people are selfish.

208
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,000
And I think this analysis and

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
people who are very good at game theory

210
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,840
probably shouldn't be making this analysis.

211
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,120
I think it's really interesting

212
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,640
and I want to explain to you why.

213
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,200
So

214
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,480
we are ending up in the bad outcome

215
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,480
because we both selfishly chose to grass

216
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,600
and there's nothing we can do about that

217
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,480
because people are selfish, right?

218
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,080
But actually the reason this happened is because

219
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,720
we when we did the game theory,

220
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
we assumed that

221
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,200
and we never spoke about this assumption.

222
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I never mentioned the assumption

223
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,520
when we went through the game,

224
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,280
we assumed that

225
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,040
both players act in such a way

226
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,240
that the only thing they care about

227
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,600
is reducing their prison time.

228
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,120
So actually, when we went through the analysis,

229
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,640
we kind of assumed that the players were selfish.

230
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,840
In reality, if you were

231
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,520
in this situation with your friend,

232
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,200
you might say, well,

233
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
you know, I don't want to betray my friend,

234
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,120
or I trust that my friend is not going to grass me up.

235
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,560
So I'm not going to...

236
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm not going to betray him

237
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,840
because he's my friend and I trust him.

238
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,560
But we didn't talk about

239
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,200
this at all in our analysis, right?

240
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,160
There are many situations

241
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,200
where this game has been tried out in game shows or in

242
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
economists experiments.

243
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,040
And what you find is actually a lot of people

244
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
in this kind of situation,

245
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,120
they won't betray their friend.

246
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,840
They will

247
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,400
stick with their friend because they like them

248
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,320
or because they trust them

249
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,000
or because they think they can get the better

250
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,320
outcome by sticking together.

251
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,240
So actually,

252
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,040
the people who have kind of proved themselves

253
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,360
to be selfish in this analysis,

254
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,680
in this analysis are the economists themselves.

255
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,720
It was the economists

256
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,800
that said you would definitely betray your friend

257
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,920
because the only thing you care about

258
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
is your prison time. And that analysis is correct.

259
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,400
If the only thing you care about

260
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,120
in the whole world

261
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,080
is reducing your prison time in this game,

262
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,920
you should definitely betray your friend. That is true.

263
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,440
But the analysis that we did that we will both grass

264
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,720
that answer, that equilibrium, that response

265
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,640
only becomes correct if we make that assumption.

266
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,160
So if we assume selfishness,

267
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,680
we get selfish outcomes, which may be bad.

268
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,160
In reality,

269
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,880
this game does nothing to tell us

270
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,640
whether people are selfish or not.

271
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,840
It only tells us that,

272
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,120
here is a game where the correct strategy

273
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,320
if the only thing you care about

274
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,720
is reducing your prison time, is to be selfish. So

275
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,120
this is my first conclusion here.

276
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,960
Anyone who ever says that game theory

277
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,920
suggests that people are selfish

278
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,560
basically doesn't understand game theory.

279
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Game theory can tell you what to do if we know exactly

280
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,120
what you want.

281
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,800
If we know what you want, we can tell you what to do.

282
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
If we know that you’re selfish,

283
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,520
we can tell you which outcome

284
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,400
sorry, which strategy is probably going

285
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,360
to give you the best selfish outcome.

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,400
If you're not selfish, if you care about other people,

287
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,320
then you can probably work together

288
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,880
and you can probably get towards

289
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,800
this good outcome of only

290
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
getting one year in prison each.

291
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,600
But that only works

292
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,720
if you have a degree of non selfishness.

293
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,680
Now I want to get onto

294
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,320
the reason I've been thinking about this

295
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,280
a lot recently.

296
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,440
Now, the reason for that is,

297
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,120
as you know, I've been running this YouTube

298
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,720
channel for three, more than three years now,

299
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,520
and the main idea behind this YouTube channel is that

300
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,600
the economy as it is, is in a really bad situation.

301
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,280
Living standards

302
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,560
for ordinary families are

303
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,800
getting worse and worse quite quickly

304
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,080
and they will continue to get worse.

305
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,360
And what I continually say on this channel is that

306
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,560
if we get together

307
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,240
and force

308
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,520
politicians to tax the rich more aggressively

309
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,400
to force wealth to flow

310
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,360
to ordinary people

311
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
rather than away from ordinary people,

312
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
we can make inequality come down.

313
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,440
We can make the economy better,

314
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,480
and we can make living standards

315
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,040
better for ordinary people.

316
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,400
And yet, when I speak to politicians about this idea,

317
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
including politicians who are

318
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,520
on the left, like politicians in the Labour Party,

319
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,000
very often they say to me, you know,

320
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,680
we can't publicly support these kinds of ideas

321
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,600
because they're not popular, because

322
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,280
they're not vote winners.

323
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,880
And when I publicly speak about these ideas,

324
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
I very often get people

325
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
push back against me and say, oh,

326
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,240
we basically, we don't want to believe that's true.

327
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,040
And when I get these kind of responses,

328
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,800
what I often feel is

329
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,040
especially when I'm talking to better off people,

330
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,360
these are people who are busy people, good jobs,

331
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
good salaries,

332
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,160
and they basically have a choice to make

333
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,800
when they hear my theories, which is do I

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,040
believe this guy? Do I agree with this guy, and do I

335
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
start to devote some of my time

336
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,680
some of my energy towards

337
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,320
basically helping him achieve his goals?

338
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,720
Or do I ignore it and say, listen, that's nonsense,

339
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,640
I don't really care about that

340
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,800
and just let him do his thing.

341
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
And when I see this play out in front of me,

342
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,280
I'm often reminded of the prisoner's dilemma because

343
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,280
that person is in a similar situation right?

344
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,040
Whatever I do, whether my project is a success or not,

345
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,400
whether we manage to reduce inequality or not,

346
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,680
this guy has to decide whether to devote

347
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,560
some of his time, some of his resources,

348
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,440
some of his energy

349
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,160
towards reducing inequality

350
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,800
and the truth of the matter is,

351
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,200
you as an individual,

352
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,400
every individual in this country,

353
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,480
whether they choose to support this or not,

354
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,440
probably won't make a difference

355
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,600
to whether we're successful or not.

356
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,480
So that person basically has the choice of

357
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
supporting and

358
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
making some sort of

359
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,560
guaranteed loss of time

360
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,560
or just ignoring and using his time in a selfish way.

361
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,880
And whatever choice he makes, he will probably

362
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,160
well, society will probably end up

363
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,520
in the same situation.

364
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,480
We will either succeed

365
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,440
and the economy will get better or we will fail

366
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,480
and the economy will get worse.

367
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,960
So once again,

368
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,600
we're in this kind of interesting situation

369
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,080
where basically,

370
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,920
if enough people are willing to act unselfishly,

371
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,040
which means

372
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,840
devoting a little bit of time, a little bit of energy

373
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,160
towards

374
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,560
watching our videos, understanding what's happening,

375
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,600
sharing the videos, telling your friends and family,

376
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,720
trying to build the big movement

377
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,960
so that a majority of this country understands

378
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,080
if we don't fix inequality, the economy will get worse.

379
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,080
If enough people do that, then

380
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,960
we can solve this problem.

381
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,720
If not enough people do that, then

382
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,760
you will continue to see what we are seeing,

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
which is living conditions

384
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,560
continue to fall relatively quickly.

385
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,000
There’s big increases in poverty,

386
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,120
life gets worse and worse for ordinary people

387
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,320
in this country.

388
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,520
And I think it's an interesting kind of...

389
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,560
essentially it's a prisoner's dilemma

390
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,000
for not just two players, but the country as a whole.

391
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,920
Every individual person in this country

392
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,080
can be a little bit better off

393
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,080
just not bothering about it

394
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,920
basically, just just do what you

395
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,200
can for yourself, for your family

396
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,560
just only worry about you

397
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,920
and the people closest to you.

398
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,400
And if enough people make that decision,

399
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,520
the economy will collapse and ordinary families

400
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,640
will be poor,

401
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,360
or people make that sacrifice,

402
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,960
a guaranteed

403
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,040
sacrifice of their time and their energy and people...

404
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
and protect the ordinary people of the country,

405
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,480
avoid the collapse of the economy.

406
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,600
And I think it's

407
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,800
a really interesting kind of

408
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,680
philosophical dilemma, right. Because,

409
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,320
you know, I grew up in this country

410
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,400
and I grew up in a culture

411
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,080
which was very much sort of get rich or die trying.

412
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
And, you know,

413
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,040
I believe it’s important to look after your family.

414
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,520
And I understand the desire to try and be selfish

415
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,080
and to try and get rich.

416
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,200
But it's created this really interesting situation

417
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,320
where if ordinary people

418
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,960
can be convinced in large enough number to be greedy,

419
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,680
then we know with certainty ordinary

420
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,240
people's kids and grandkids will be poor.

421
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,000
It's interesting, right,

422
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,680
because you would think

423
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,160
being greedy would make you rich.

424
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,240
But we've created this game where

425
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,840
if we can convince enough people,

426
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,680
poor people and ordinary people to be greedy enough,

427
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,000
then we can absolutely bankrupt the kids of

428
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
poor and ordinary people.

429
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,680
So in a sense, it's kind of a

430
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,960
it's kind of a test, really.

431
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,480
It's a test for the people of this country, basically.

432
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,360
Are enough people willing

433
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,000
to make that sacrifice of time and effort

434
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,880
to educate themselves, to educate each other,

435
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,400
that the only way we can reduce inequality is together?

436
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,840
Or basically, are we too selfish to do that?

437
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,400
And are we going to drive ourselves into poverty?

438
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,080
So listen,

439
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,080
game theory teaches us not that people are selfish,

440
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,280
but that if enough people are selfish,

441
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,200
basically we can completely f*ck them over.

442
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,920
And I think this is kind of the situation that

443
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,280
we are in as a country.

444
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,000
I think the culture of

445
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,960
our country has sort of moved

446
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,560
in a direction in the last 40, 50 years

447
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,240
where people have been trained to be selfish

448
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,560
and the big problem with this is

449
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,520
if everyone is selfish and everybody fights selfishly,

450
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,960
then it becomes easy for the very powerful

451
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,480
and the very rich to take everything

452
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,120
from the ordinary and from the weak.

453
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,080
And that is what is happening,

454
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,520
essentially, I believe in the economy,

455
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
and that is why life is getting worse.

456
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,000
And the only power that ordinary people

457
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,960
have to protect themselves

458
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,480
and the rich and the powerful is

459
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,240
that there's a lot of them

460
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
and they only use that power

461
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,840
if they act unselfishly and work together.

462
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,000
So, listen, I believe we can fix the economy.

463
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,320
We can only do it by dealing

464
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,800
realistically with inequality.

465
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,160
The rich are not going to support that

466
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
and they're going to oppose it. And they do oppose it.

467
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,600
But we can stop that by working together.

468
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm going to do that. I'm going to keep working on it.

469
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,120
That's why we put these videos out every week.

470
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,560
And I hope you do too.

471
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,000
So please

472
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,880
watch these videos, share these videos and

473
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,000
help us bring people together

474
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,040
and fix this economy by understanding it better.

475
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,560
Thank you.
