00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,080
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,840
Today we are going to talk about

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,080
if you tax the rich, they’ll leave.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,560
We have done a video on this channel

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,520
about whether it is possible to tax the rich before.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,280
I did it about a year ago.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,400
I went and watched it before I did this video.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,480
And the reason I watched it is

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,280
because we have been getting tons

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,440
and tons and tons of comments,

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,640
which is you can't tax the rich they’ll leave.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,160
You can't tax rich they’ll leave.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,240
It is by far the most popular comment on the channel.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,720
It's the most frequent criticism

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,960
to whether you should tax the rich.

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,880
So I didn't want to do a video

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,120
because we'd already done one before,

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,320
but I went and checked and it's only got 10,000 views.

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,760
And obviously since then the channel has grown a lot.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,320
We've got a lot of new people.

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,600
This is clearly the number one concern

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
about why we cannot tax the rich.

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,440
So I wanted to do a video, deal with it head on.

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,400
And explain really, really clearly why we can

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,120
tax the rich.

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,520
Okay.

27
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,240
So this argument

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,600
that we cannot tax the rich because they’ll leave

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,680
is basically based on a confusion

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,640
between rich people who are rich

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,800
because they have a good job

32
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,520
and they make money from their work,

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,680
and rich people who are rich

34
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,480
because they own a lot of assets.

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,560
Now, ordinary people don't have great visibility

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,680
with regards to extremely wealthy families, families

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,120
who have

38
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,400
asset hoardings of £10 million, £100 million, £1 billion.

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,320
So ordinary people,

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,880
when they think of the rich, they tend

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,040
to think of people with good jobs

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
doctors, lawyers, bankers, businessmen,

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
people who might earn 100, 200,

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
maybe even more thousand pounds a year.

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,200
and these people,

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,480
if you tax them, in many cases, they can leave.

47
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,320
I was a trader for a long time.

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,160
I made a lot of money when I was doing that.

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,480
I paid a lot tax,

50
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
but if I wanted, I could have gone to work in

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,240
most famously Singapore, which has a lower tax rate.

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,120
So it's possible for people who

53
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,520
have very high incomes from their work to leave

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,280
because they get their money from their work

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,800
and they can work anywhere in a higher

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,080
tax country or a low tax country.

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,920
When I talk about taxing the rich,

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm not talking about these people.

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,800
And I want to make it very clear from the start.

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
I said it a lot of times on the channel,

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,880
but I think some people still don't recognise it

62
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,560
when I talk about taxing the rich.

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,480
This is not about highly paid workers.

64
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,760
This is about individuals and families

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,000
that have tens

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,720
or hundreds of millions of pounds or dollars in assets,

67
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,680
maybe even billions of pounds or dollars in assets.

68
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
These are the people I want to tax.

69
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,280
Now, when we consider a billionaire

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,840
or somebody worth, let's say, £1 billion or £100 million,

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,520
they do not get their income

72
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,080
from working in the vast majority of cases. If you are,

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
say Rishi Sunak who’s worth £700 million, he owns assets,

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,680
he owns assets, this is, he owns buildings,

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,640
he owns properties, he owns companies,

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,320
he owns debt, for example

77
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,120
he owns your mortgage, he owns the government debt.

78
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,160
This is what rich people own.

79
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
They get their income as what is considered

80
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
passive income.

81
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,360
They get it whether they work or not

82
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
because it doesn't come from the work,

83
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,160
it comes from their assets.

84
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,920
And what this means is it comes essentially from you.

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
They own your house,

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
they own the supermarket you shop in,

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,280
they own the fields that produce the food that you eat.

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,520
They own the natural resources

89
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,920
which produce the electricity you use.

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,800
They own the office block that you work in.

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,960
They own your mortgage, they own the government debt.

92
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,600
So when you pay taxes, it goes to them.

93
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,720
If you don't understand this concept of what wealth is

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
and what wealth ownership is, I really recommend

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,080
you watch the video on the channel called What is Wealth.

96
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
We also,

97
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
I think we're going to put this out the week

98
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,600
after we do a new video explaining really clearly what wealth is.

99
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,640
So this is the difference

100
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
between somebody who works for their money

101
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,000
and somebody who owns for their money.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,080
Working people can leave and work in another country.

103
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,360
But if I own £1 billion

104
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,760
of UK government bonds or £1 billion of UK property,

105
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,160
regardless of whether I live in the country or not,

106
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,120
that money is coming from you,

107
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,400
when you pay your rent and you when you pay your taxes.

108
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,520
Rich people who are rich,

109
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,280
rich through asset ownership, asset hoarding,

110
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,040
they get their money from you.

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
So this is the key thing to understand, right?

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,360
I'm not talking about taxing working people.

113
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,880
I'm talking about the people that own the assets.

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,240
They own the assets of this country.

115
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,320
They own British assets.

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,280
They own the land. They own the buildings.

117
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,480
They own the companies. They own the debt.

118
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,640
They own British assets.

119
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,960
So let's talk about these people. Can they leave?

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
So at the moment

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,520
we have a tax system in this country

122
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,240
which is common in western countries.

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
It's same in Western Europe, it's the same in the US,

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,800
which taxes you based on where you live.

125
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,920
And what that means is I could go into France

126
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,480
if I was a billionaire and buy

127
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,400
€5 billion

128
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,560
worth of French property of French businesses,

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,760
and then I could leave,

130
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,440
I could move to the Cayman Islands,

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
and I could take loads of French rent payments, French

132
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,160
mortgage payments,

133
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,200
money from French customers

134
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,560
and basically pay no tax on it.

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,840
Because even though I own half of France

136
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,480
or half of Britain or half of the US,

137
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,040
I don't live in those countries, so I don't pay tax.

138
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,400
And this is basically,

139
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
a completely absurd tax system,

140
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,160
which we don't have to use. Not every country does this.

141
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,840
China doesn't

142
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,960
allow you to own half of China

143
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,760
and not pay any tax on the money

144
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,880
that you extract from Chinese people,

145
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
because you don't live in China.

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Other countries don't allow this.

147
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,560
We do allow this but we don't have to.

148
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
The basic fact is,

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,480
if you own a tonne of British assets,

150
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
be that

151
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,080
companies that sell to British

152
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,080
consumers, British homes, British debt,

153
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,640
British land, British natural resources,

154
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,880
your money comes from Britain.

155
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,560
And that would be the same if I was talking about the US,

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,880
if I was talking about Australia,

157
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,000
if I was talking about Germany or France,

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
you exist in a country that has real assets.

159
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,480
Those assets are owned by somebody.

160
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,400
And whenever you use those assets,

161
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,720
you pay that person and the money comes from you.

162
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,360
So this is the big reason why

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,080
the very richest people in society

164
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,320
are actually the easiest technically to tax

165
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,760
is because, if I'm a teacher or a lawyer or a doctor,

166
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,680
I can go to Dubai, I can go to Singapore

167
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,080
and I can work in those countries

168
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,520
and I generate the money from my work.

169
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,680
If I'm rich and I own your country,

170
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,160
whether I leave or not, my money still comes from you

171
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,080
and it's...

172
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,840
I’m the least mobile person in the world

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,320
from a tax perspective.

174
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
Because whereas a worker can move

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,320
and work in another country,

176
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,680
the owners of the assets,

177
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
they all your country

178
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,680
and of course your country can decide

179
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,960
whether to tax them or not.

180
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
So I think once you understand this difference,

181
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,160
that taxing the rich,

182
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,880
when I use

183
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,120
it, is not about taxing working people,

184
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,880
it's about taxing the owners of the wealth.

185
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,320
I think what you can recognise from

186
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,200
that is the fundamental question we are dealing with here

187
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,640
is who owns your country?

188
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,240
Who owns the wealth of your country?

189
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,800
Look around you in the place that you live.

190
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Look around you in the country that you live.

191
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,160
Look at all of the land.

192
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,400
Look at all of the buildings.

193
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Look at all of the property.

194
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Look at all of the productive buildings and machinery

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
and all of the natural resources.

196
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,000
Somebody owns that.

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,120
Who do you want to own it?

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,560
We are in a state of transition in the West,

199
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,680
where we used to have a large middle class

200
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
that owned a lot of the wealth.

201
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,080
They are losing that

202
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,240
through increased debt

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,280
and through decreased

204
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,440
direct ownership of things

205
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,480
like property, things like the stock market,

206
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,200
which are increasingly being owned by wealthy people.

207
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,920
If you allow the very rich

208
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,040
to own the wealth in your country,

209
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,960
claim that they don't live in your country

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,600
so that they don't pay tax on your country,

211
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,080
despite the fact

212
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,280
that all of the people in your country are paying their rent,

213
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,320
are paying their mortgages, are paying company

214
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,760
profits to these people,

215
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,960
it is inevitable that they will accumulate

216
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
more and more of your country,

217
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
and eventually you will lose your middle class.

218
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,560
And this is the reason that we do

219
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,920
everything on this channel.

220
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,480
And I think there's a kind of absurd thing

221
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,960
that happens here where,

222
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,120
I say tax the rich to protect the workers.

223
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
And very,

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,680
very rich people pay a lot of money

225
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,600
to pay a lot of people to tell you,

226
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Gary wants to tax you.

227
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
The reality is,

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
unless you're a very rich person,

229
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
if you are part of the middle class

230
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,520
or even poorer than the middle class in your country,

231
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,240
you are losing your assets to the rich.

232
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,440
And the rich are not paying tax.

233
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,520
And I really think we need to start viewing tax

234
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,440
really, in the same way that we view an army.

235
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,680
The reason that countries have armies is to stop

236
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,720
foreign invaders from coming in

237
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,840
and taking all of the land and taking all of the assets.

238
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,520
That is happening.

239
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,560
It is happening now.

240
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,680
The middle class are losing their assets to the rich.

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,200
We can see that in decreased homeownership rates,

242
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
in more increased ownership of the stock market,

243
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,960
in much higher levels of debt from ordinary families

244
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
and from governments to the rich.

245
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,520
You are losing your assets.

246
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,600
You are losing your assets

247
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,760
and you are competing with people

248
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,240
like Rishi Sunak, who have passive incomes

249
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,520
of £1 million a week,

250
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,400
and there is no way for you to compete with them.

251
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,160
What they own is your assets.

252
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
They own your house.

253
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,880
They own the building you work in.

254
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,240
They own the building you shop in.

255
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
They own the bar.

256
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,600
They own the restaurants. They own the natural resources.

257
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,920
All of those things exist in your country.

258
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,640
They exist in your country, and you can tax them.

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,560
We don't tax them because in many cases

260
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,000
we have a very, very wealthy political class

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
that is funded by them

262
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,520
and just simply told you that we can't, but we can.

263
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,400
We can.

264
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,200
China does it.

265
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,760
Lots of countries have done it in the past,

266
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,720
but at the moment we have...

267
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
basically, I would argue there’s

268
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,600
a degree of political capture,

269
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,720
where the very rich not only influence

270
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,320
the politicians to not tax them, but to tax you instead,

271
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,600
but they also influence the media and the economists

272
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,120
to tell you that it's impossible to tax them.

273
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,040
Listen, these guys are not magicians.

274
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,560
They can leave the country.

275
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,200
The assets are here. We don't need them.

276
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
We need their assets.

277
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
It's about ownership of the assets.

278
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,360
It's about ownership of the country you live in.

279
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,640
Now, I want to be clear

280
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,960
when I say that it's possible to tax them.

281
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,440
That is 100% true because we don't need...

282
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,440
These are people who don't want we don't need the labour.

283
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,960
What we need is their assets.

284
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,400
The assets

285
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,920
exist in this country

286
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,040
or in the country, in the West where we live,

287
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
we can tax them.

288
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,360
That doesn't mean it's going to be easy.

289
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,040
I don't think it's easy.

290
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,000
I think it's going to be really, really hard.

291
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But I don't do it because it's easy.

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,400
I do it because I think it's important

293
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,240
that my country and your country, whichever country is,

294
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,200
doesn't collapse into desperate poverty.

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
And the only way to protect the middle class

296
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,880
and the poor from the rich is taxation.

297
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,440
Just like the only way to protect you from

298
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,240
foreign armies is an army.

299
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,960
We don't have the taxation,

300
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,080
and we are moving back towards being a very unequal,

301
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,960
very high poverty society.

302
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,040
I campaign for taxation of the rich.

303
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,280
Not because it is easy, but because it is essential.

304
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,720
And, we are going to move into a period now

305
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,880
where we have a change of government in this country.

306
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
And if I'm totally honest,

307
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,760
I think that the previous government,

308
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
you know,

309
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
the Prime Minister is worth £700 million,

310
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,240
David Cameron made £10 million

311
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,800
in a year of leaving office.

312
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,480
They all went to the most elite private schools

313
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,920
and come from wealthy families.

314
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,840
I think that that government

315
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,560
was basically aggressively

316
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,800
protecting the class interests of the rich.

317
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,080
And, I don't think they ever would have given us

318
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,200
what we need in terms of stopping

319
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
the increases in inequality.

320
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
But we're going to move now into a period

321
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,360
of having a government which, rather than saying

322
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,440
we don't want to stop inequality increasing,

323
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,720
they will be saying it would be nice

324
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,280
to stop inequality increasing,

325
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,520
but it's not practical

326
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,320
or it's not sensible or it's too difficult

327
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
or it's not worth the effort.

328
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,800
Personally, I think it is worth the effort to stop

329
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,840
your societies from collapsing into desperate poverty.

330
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,560
and it's not easy, but it's essential.

331
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,880
And I think sometimes it's important

332
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,080
for people to try to do things that are difficult

333
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,480
because they are essential

334
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,680
to stop the collapses of their societies.

335
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,520
And previous generations did things like that.

336
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,920
And it is through the work of those previous generations

337
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,080
that I live in a country

338
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,760
which for a long time provided decent living standards

339
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
and housing and education

340
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,640
and healthcare to ordinary people.

341
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,720
That's not normal.

342
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,680
In most of the world

343
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
ordinary people don't get good quality

344
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,080
housing and education and healthcare and leisure time.

345
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,360
But we had it here in the UK and we had it in the US

346
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,760
and in Europe and Australia and Japan

347
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
for 50, 60 years

348
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,400
because people fought for it,

349
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,280
despite the fact that before they had it,

350
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,360
it had never happened before in modern society.

351
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,600
Taxing the rich will be very, very difficult.

352
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
It's possible these people are not magicians.

353
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,720
These people are not Gandalf.

354
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,200
They can't magic themselves

355
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
out of the country and disappear

356
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,280
all of the wealth out of the country.

357
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,800
The wealth is here. It is the wealth of our countries.

358
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,760
But if we allow it to be held

359
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,080
by a small group of extremely wealthy families

360
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,880
who pretend they live

361
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,200
in the Cayman Islands and pay no tax,

362
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,840
then we and our kids

363
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,800
and our grandkids will live in poverty.

364
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,080
So it's difficult, but it's possible.

365
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
I want to do it.

366
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm going to keep campaigning for it

367
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
and I hope you support us on this channel.

368
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,360
This is the big question we can ask all the time.

369
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Can we tax the rich?

370
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,320
Okay, it's not about working people.

371
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,040
It's about the people who are hoarding our assets

372
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,520
and stealing our countries. The assets are here.

373
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,560
The wealth is here. We can tax it. Thank you.
