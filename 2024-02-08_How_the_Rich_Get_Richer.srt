1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,280
Okay, welcome back to Gary's economics.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,000
Today, we are going to explain why the rich get richer.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,680
All right. So I was talking the other day

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,040
to a good friend of mine,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,120
a Dutch guy who I studied economics with back at Oxford

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,560
when I was doing my Master's in ‘17 to ’19.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,400
And when I was at Oxford, I was very adamant,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,080
very adamant that the

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,120
economy would get worse and worse for ordinary people.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,480
Living standards would fall

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,400
because inequality was increasing and increasing.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,720
Now, this is not a popular idea

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,080
in modern university, academic economics.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,960
And this guy sort of was quite skeptical at the time,

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,560
but it's obviously been five or six years since then.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,240
And he and I

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,920
and you have seen

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,440
inequality massively increase

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,480
and living standards massively decrease.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,960
And he's kind of started to be convinced

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
that I'm correct, which

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
if you stick with my channel for long enough

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,200
and keep seeing my predictions

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,960
be right, hopefully you will be too.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,520
So he messaged me the other day, and he was like, look,

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,240
I think you're right.

27
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,200
Inequality is just destroying the economy.

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
I think it's important,

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,920
we need to do something about it.

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,200
But he asked me, why is it that suddenly now

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,040
in the last

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,440
twenty years, ten years,

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,560
especially the last five years,

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,040
why is inequality increasing now?

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,240
What is actually causing the increase in inequality?

36
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,720
And I thought that was a really interesting question

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,120
and something that was worth

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,400
discussing and explaining on the channel.

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,920
So I think the first thing you need to know

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,720
in order to answer that question

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,080
is that for the vast majority of human history,

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,320
at least in the last 2000 years,

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,440
human societies have been extremely unequal

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,240
and living standards have been, in most cases,

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,440
very, very low.

46
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,560
It was only really after the Second World War

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,000
that inequality decreased significantly

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,720
in parts of the world,

49
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,960
here in the UK, in Western Europe,

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,840
North America, places like Japan.

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,000
But of course in the rest of the world,

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
inequality stayed very high

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
and living standards stayed very low.

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
But if you go back and look before World War Two,

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,040
basically most of history is

56
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,840
extremely unequal societies.

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
So I think in order to answer the question,

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
why is inequality rising now?

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,560
You first need to understand that

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,440
really it is the last 70 years that are the exception.

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
What we have had is an exceptional period

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,600
only in certain places, which is that

63
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Western Europe, North America,

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,800
Japan, Australia, a few other places

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,480
have had historically

66
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
very equal,

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
low inequality societies

68
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,720
for 70 years and very high living standards.

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
That's not normal.

70
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,160
That didn't exist

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,040
almost ever basically. It was a specific period.

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,200
So the reason that I mention that is

73
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
it's not actually something

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,240
unusual that is happening now,

75
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,800
that inequality is becoming very large.

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,120
This is actually the norm.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,640
So I think if we look at human history,

78
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,480
we kind of have to accept that human societies

79
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,640
tend towards very high levels of inequality.

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,000
And we have a few examples

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
in the last 70 years of places

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,080
where that didn't happen.

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
So let's discuss why it happens,

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
why the inequality grows

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,800
in the context of this basically always happens.

86
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,640
And what I said to my friend was really,

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680
really it’s very simple.

88
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,880
So you can look at it in the very specific case,

89
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,280
which is in our societies that we live in now.

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,920
What happens is you go to work,

91
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,040
you get paid your 30, 40 grand a year.

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,600
You spend almost all of it on

93
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,400
rent, mortgage,

94
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
food, bills,

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
and it goes towards the owners of the properties,

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,720
the owners of the debt, the owners of the

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,520
production, of the things that you need,

98
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,840
which is essentially rich people.

99
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640
So you go to work, you make 40 grand,

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
you give it all to rich people.

101
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,760
They use that to buy the rest of the assets.

102
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,280
It's a relatively simple dynamic.

103
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,520
I've spoken about it a lot on the channel.

104
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
But this is the specific case.

105
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,680
I think what this is,

106
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,240
is a specific example

107
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,520
of basically a more general concept,

108
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,200
which is when power is unequally distributed,

109
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,160
people who have a lot of power,

110
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,280
which in our society basically means rich people

111
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,360
can use that power to dispossess the less powerful.

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
So in our society,

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,200
that means rich people use your salary,

114
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,120
which you've paid to them, they give it to their

115
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,440
kids, their kids buy your house.

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
Your kids don't have a house.

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
But this can manifest differently in different ways.

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
This is simply

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,480
a specific case of the general rule

120
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,680
that when power is unequal,

121
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,120
the powerful can dispossessed the weak.

122
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,680
And this leads very naturally

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,400
to an accumulation of power. I'm powerful. You're not.

124
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,360
I use that power to take your stuff. And

125
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,280
you can see this happen.

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,000
If you look throughout

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,120
sort of the history of medieval Europe.

128
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,080
What you saw was, for a period

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,480
it was lots of small states.

130
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,160
And then when certain kingdoms became powerful,

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,160
they used that power to take the kingdoms around them.

132
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,840
It's another example of this, you know,

133
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,640
this is why human history tends

134
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,920
towards high levels of inequality,

135
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,760
because once you have inequality,

136
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,120
then the rich can use their power

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
to dispossess the weak. And that's all of history.

138
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,520
That is all of history.

139
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
That is what happens in human societies.

140
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
If you look at the history of human societies,

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,840
human societies have always been very unequal,

142
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,480
except for one period in time,

143
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,160
70 years after the Second World War,

144
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,640
when a lot of societies

145
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,160
suddenly became much more equal.

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,640
Why was that?

147
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,840
I think the best clue, I always remember

148
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,560
there's a song by the Beatles.

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm a big fan of the Beatles,

150
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
first time I’ve mentioned that on the channel,

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
called Taxman.

152
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah, one of the opening lines of the song

153
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,960
is written from the perspective of the Taxman,

154
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,080
which says, one for you, 19 for Me.

155
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,840
And this is because the Beatles, at the

156
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,200
peak of their success, were paying

157
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,080
95% top income tax rate in the UK.

158
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,880
Now, I'm not advocating for a 95% top income tax rate.

159
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,560
The top inheritance tax rate at the time was 90%

160
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
during that period up until the eighties specifically,

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,960
we had in Western Europe and also in America,

162
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,080
which has a reputation as a low tax society,

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,240
up until the eighties we had extremely high tax rates

164
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,640
on the very rich

165
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,840
and that basically prevented

166
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,360
the rich from rapidly accumulating

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,760
wealth of the rest of their countries.

168
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,160
That is the exception. That is the exception.

169
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
If you have systems that prevent the rich

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,280
and the powerful from taking the wealth and power

171
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,680
of the poor, then you can prevent it.

172
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360
If you don't have those system, you can't prevent it.

173
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,840
So the reason that inequality is increasing

174
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,120
is that

175
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,440
the rich are very powerful

176
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
and they can

177
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,200
use the income that they get from you

178
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,320
to take the rest of the stuff.

179
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,960
And this is always the way it has been

180
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,040
and it's always the way it will be.

181
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
But I don't want to be excessively fatalistic here

182
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,280
because I see people in the comments

183
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
all the time saying it was always like that.

184
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,640
It was always like that.

185
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,320
Listen, we had 70 years when it was not like that.

186
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,520
We had 70 years

187
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,800
when inequality was unusually low

188
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
in a lot of countries, especially, you know,

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,880
most of the countries of Western Europe,

190
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
and that was 70 years in which

191
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
postmen and cleaners and hairdressers

192
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,600
could buy houses and go on holidays

193
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,320
and raise families and afford space.

194
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
This is not the norm.

195
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,680
This is not the norm.

196
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
But we had that because we had

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,240
very high rates of tax on wealthier people.

198
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,480
Listen, you need that.

199
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,200
You need to have structures in place in your economy

200
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,960
that prevent the rich from taking all of the wealth.

201
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,320
If you don't have that, history teaches us

202
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,840
the rich get all of the wealth.

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,200
And once the rich have all of the wealth,

204
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,080
not just history, but the present world shows us

205
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
ordinary people end up with very poor

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,880
living conditions.

207
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,280
If you go to countries that are very unequal,

208
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,840
if you go to...

209
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,520
I mean, it's most of the world, to be honest.

210
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,360
You go to a places like India, South Africa,

211
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,040
you know, almost anywhere in Latin America,

212
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,080
very unequal societies

213
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,200
lead to very poor living standards.

214
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,680
This is the norm.

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
We prevented it before.

216
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
We prevented it by levying

217
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,400
very high tax rates on the very, very rich. So,

218
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,720
you know, I know I see

219
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,160
people in the comments all the time

220
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
accusing me of being a communist

221
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,160
because I want high tax rates on the rich.

222
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,560
Listen, I'm a trader in my heart of hearts.

223
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,880
I made a lot of money betting on this.

224
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm still betting on it now.

225
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,160
My firm belief

226
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,960
is that if you don't tax rich people,

227
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,440
living standards collapse for ordinary people.

228
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
It's happening now. It will continue to happen.

229
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,120
We can reverse it, but we need to tax the rich.

230
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,600
And I'm not talking about you, Dave,

231
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,960
in the comments, who's an accountant making £60 grand.

232
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm talking about families with £10 million,

233
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,640
£100 million in assets.

234
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
If you don't tax them,

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
they'll take everything

236
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,400
that includes all of your assets,

237
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,760
your kids will be poor, your grandkids will be poor.

238
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
You won’t own anything.

239
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,040
You need to protect yourself

240
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,200
from the people who are taking your assets,

241
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
that is the rich.

242
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,880
We're fighting against it. Support the channel.

243
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
Educate yourself,

244
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,040
educate your friends, educate your family.

245
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,600
If enough people say no, we can change it

246
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,240
just like we changed after World War Two.

247
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,560
But it needs enough people

248
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,440
to step forward and push back.

249
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,040
I'm pushing. I hope you’ll push too.

250
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,240
Thank you very much.
