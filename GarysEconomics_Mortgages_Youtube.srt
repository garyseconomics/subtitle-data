1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,160
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,520
Today we are going to explain mortgages.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,120
Okay, I wanted to do a video on mortgages.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,280
And the reason being is

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,240
I talk a lot in this video

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,360
about wealth inequality increasing.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,200
That means wealth is being transferred

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,480
away from primarily

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
ordinary people, middle classes towards the very rich.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
And there's a variety of ways

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,120
in which we see that happening.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,920
So number one is lower rates of homeownership.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,760
And we're really seeing that

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,160
especially for younger people.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,000
Number two

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,480
is the lack of ability of people to accumulate

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,800
financial assets like stocks and shares.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,120
So we primarily see that through pensions.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,800
Older generations were much more able to accumulate

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,920
financial assets in pensions. And now they're not.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,720
Number three is the loss of government wealth,

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,640
which means government

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,280
privatisations and increased government debt.

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
But those first three...

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,760
well, the first one is very visible.

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,960
The second one,

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,000
less pensions

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,480
and less government wealth, we often don't see them.

29
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,640
What we often

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,680
do see and one of the most visible ways

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,800
in which ordinary families are becoming poorer versus

32
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,720
the very rich is increased sizes of mortgages.

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
And I wanted to speak a little bit about that,

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,400
because I think a lot of people don't

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,280
see the way in which increased sizes of mortgages

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,480
is a transfer of wealth from

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,920
the middle class towards the super rich.

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,560
I think they kind of think

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
house prices going up, mortgages are bigger,

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,080
that's just the way it is.

41
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,320
And in this video I'm

42
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,640
going to explain

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,680
how increase to mortgage debt

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,840
is a manifestation of increased wealth inequality.

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
So the first thing I need to explain

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,320
in order to explain

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,920
this is something that I have spoken

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
about before on the channel.

49
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,920
We've got two videos, one called Debt and one called

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
What is Money?

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,640
If you want to understand these concepts better,

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
you can go and watch them afterwards.

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,680
The basic concept which you need to understand is

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,080
total mortgage debt is always zero.

55
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,320
This is the first you need to understand.

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,200
Total mortgage debt is always zero.

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,360
If you look at the amount of debt across

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,120
the whole society, mortgage debt is always zero.

59
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,760
And that might seem crazy.

60
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,280
You know,

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,160
so many people have mortgages,

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,400
how could it possibly add up to zero?

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,680
That is because

64
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,240
every debt has a creditor.

65
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
For everyone who is in debt,

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
there is somebody who is in credit.

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,360
Your money is always owed to somebody.

68
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,000
So what that means on a very simple level

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
is, the total amount of debt

70
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,840
always has to equal the total amount of credit

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,120
and the total amount of mortgage interest

72
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,400
that is

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
paid always has to equal the total

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
amount of mortgage interest

75
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,600
that is received by somebody.

76
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,320
So what that means is, it is not possible for

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,600
mortgage debt to

78
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,080
grow massively for the middle classes,

79
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,200
for ordinary families,

80
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,400
unless somebody is accumulating a huge amount of money.

81
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Now this is an important concept,

82
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,760
and I think I'm going to sit on it for a little bit

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,320
and explain it a little bit more clearly,

84
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,680
because I think it's important

85
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,120
to understand

86
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,080
how debt works

87
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,640
and how money works in order to understand

88
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,200
how mortgages are working in our society.

89
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,640
We live in a debt based monetary system.

90
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,360
That's true whether you're in the UK,

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,760
the US, Europe, Australia, anywhere.

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,920
Our monetary system is a debt based monetary system.

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,720
What I mean by

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,200
that is

95
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
all money in our society

96
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,520
is created by the making of a loan.

97
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,080
So at the very first instance,

98
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,520
money is created by, in this country,

99
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,920
the Bank of England,

100
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,440
lending money to a commercial bank

101
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,440
such as Lloyds, Halifax, Barclays. So at that point

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,520
a bank borrows money from the Bank of England.

103
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,520
They get money and they also get debt.

104
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,160
The money and the debt are created at the same time.

105
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,840
And that's important

106
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
and it has to work like that

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,120
because the person who has the money

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
receives the interest,

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
and it is only possible to receive interest

110
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
if somebody is paying interest.

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,280
And if somebody is paying interest,

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,440
that means somebody has debt.

113
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,000
Now all money in our monetary system works like this.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,240
It's not obvious that that is happening.

115
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,240
And I'll explain why, I’ll give you an example.

116
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,920
So say I borrow £100 from the bank.

117
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,200
I've got £100.

118
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,880
Then I use that £100 to pay Jack

119
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,480
for filming this video.

120
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Jack then has the £100, but he doesn't have the debt.

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
I've got the debt.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,720
So from the perspective of Jack, he just thinks, well,

123
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,560
I've got £100.

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,760
You know, there's no debt against this £100.

125
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,120
But if you look from the perspective

126
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,600
of the whole of society,

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,160
there has to be a debt balancing it.

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
And in this case, I'm the person with the debt.

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
So I pay interest to the bank that lent me the money.

130
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,040
And then the Bank of England pays interest to Jack. So

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,600
I really want to hammer this in.

132
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,440
Because you need to understand this.

133
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,960
All money is credit. All money is debt.

134
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,720
All money is credit.

135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,680
All money is debt.

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,120
In fact,

137
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,040
I think you understand money better if you

138
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
you almost stop using the term money at all

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,280
and you just think about money as credit.

140
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,600
Every form of money is credit.

141
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
What that means is

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
it is money owed to you by someone,

143
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,080
and they pay you interest on that money.

144
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,120
So if you have money in Barclays Bank, that's credit.

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
Barclays owes you that money.

146
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,600
If you have a government bond that's credit

147
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
the government owes you that money.

148
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,520
And even if we think about cash,

149
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,840
if you pull a banknote out of your wallet,

150
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,400
you will see at the top it says here,

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,920
I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of £20.

152
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
I don't think you'll be able to get that,

153
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,440
but if you've got a £20 note.

154
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,200
So even this cash is

155
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,720
essentially a form of credit

156
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,040
the government offers to pay you money.

157
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
And if you give this money to a bank,

158
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,520
the government will pay interest on this cash.

159
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,840
That's why you can make money on cash.

160
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,080
So all money is credit, and all money is debt.

161
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,240
There is always somebody in debt

162
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,960
for every piece of money or credit anybody has.

163
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,880
And that has to be true.

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,040
Otherwise there would be nobody to pay the interest.

165
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,960
On the flip side, if anybody has debt,

166
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,360
there is always somebody with credit against it.

167
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,320
This is the way money works.

168
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,120
I always get some people get very angry

169
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,840
when I say this on the channel.

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,200
Unfortunately, it is true.

171
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
We live in a debt based monetary system.

172
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,360
Debt and credit always have to totally equal.

173
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
So what this means is

174
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,480
if mortgage debt is suddenly exploding

175
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,040
and getting much bigger,

176
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,880
somebody somewhere must be accumulating

177
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,840
an enormous amount of credit.

178
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,640
Somebody somewhere must be accumulating

179
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,680
an enormous amount of money.

180
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,400
And the reverse is also true.

181
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
If some group

182
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
somewhere is accumulating an enormous amount of money,

183
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,040
somebody must be going into debt.

184
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,320
It's the only... it's the only way it works.

185
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,840
These two things have to balance.

186
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,480
So if one group in society tries to accumulate money,

187
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,240
somebody else has to accumulate debt.

188
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,520
If one group in society starts to accumulate debt

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
somebody else has to accumulate money.

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,760
These debts and credits, this debt and money

191
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,720
that are the same thing,

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,480
there are two sides of the same coin.

193
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,840
One side cannot exist without the other.

194
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,720
So when you see mortgage debt increasing massively,

195
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,840
or for example,

196
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,920
when you see government debt increasing

197
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,480
massively during Covid, you should be asking yourself

198
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,000
who is accumulating money here?

199
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
And you should be understanding

200
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,320
it is only possible for those debts to increase

201
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,480
because a group is accumulating money.

202
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,120
And in fact, if a group accumulates money,

203
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,720
they are forcing somebody to go into debt.

204
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,000
So in a very real sense,

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,640
these increased mortgages, these increased debts

206
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,720
of ordinary families of the middle class,

207
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,640
they literally

208
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,760
are the accumulations of wealth of the rich.

209
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,200
It would not be possible

210
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,680
for your family, for your kids,

211
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,280
for your grandkids to go massively into debt

212
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,760
unless some group of people, which in this case is...

213
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,440
which in this case is the very rich

214
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,880
are accumulating money.

215
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,000
In fact, what you are seeing here

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,200
is a manifestation of what I talk about

217
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,480
in my Flows of Wealth video,

218
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,040
which is when you live in a very wealth,

219
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,680
unequal society, as increasingly we do.

220
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,880
What that means is a small group of people own

221
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,480
all of the

222
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,640
companies, they own all of the commercial property,

223
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
they own most of the properties.

224
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,960
And ordinary people

225
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,600
are continually having to pay them rents,

226
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,960
profits and interest.

227
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,800
If inequality

228
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
gets very large,

229
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,880
these flows of cash

230
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,920
from ordinary families to the rich become very large.

231
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,560
And they have to balance somehow.

232
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,480
And there's only really three ways

233
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,120
that those cash flows can be balanced.

234
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,600
One is ordinary

235
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,800
people work much more for the rich,

236
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,640
although in reality, if you try and do that,

237
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,040
it tends to just push wages down.

238
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,240
Two is ordinary families sell their assets to the rich,

239
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
and that is why we are seeing reduced

240
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,120
homeownership rates and reduced ability

241
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,240
to save in pensions.

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
But the third one is

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,720
the rich can lend that money back to the poor.

244
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,920
And that is what we're seeing when we see

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,480
mortgage sizes increase.

246
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,080
What you are seeing

247
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
there is the rich taking enormous

248
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,040
amounts of money from working families

249
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,960
and then lending it back.

250
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
Okay, but up till now, that's

251
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,440
all been very theoretical.

252
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,240
But I want to talk about how it works in practice.

253
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,280
So let's take a practical example,

254
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,840
which happened recently.

255
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,080
So I speak a lot on the channel

256
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,200
about how during Covid, governments

257
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,960
gave out an enormous amount of money.

258
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,800
And that money was largely,

259
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,080
in the end, accumulated by richer people.

260
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
If you want to understand how that worked,

261
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,240
you can go and watch our first video on the channel

262
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,000
How The Rich Got Rich From Covid 19.

263
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,320
When these rich people started to accumulate cash,

264
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,160
what do they do?

265
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,800
So rich people,

266
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,880
they tend to want to own a balanced portfolio.

267
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
What that means is

268
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,960
they want to own things like stocks and shares,

269
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,440
but they also want to own things like bonds,

270
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,560
because bonds pay a very regular interest

271
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
and they want to own things like gold.

272
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,920
They want to own property as well.

273
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,360
At first they'll go out and they'll...

274
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
they’ll buy the stuff that's easy to buy,

275
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,960
stocks and shares these kinds of things.

276
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
But eventually

277
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
they're going to want to diversify

278
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,080
and they're going to want to own property.

279
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,440
But the problem with property is it's very difficult

280
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
for super rich people

281
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,560
to buy enormous amounts of property.

282
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:18,960
So say,

283
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
if you if you're very rich

284
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,880
and you suddenly receive an income of £10 million,

285
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,960
you can quite easily buy £10 million of stocks.

286
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,840
You can do it really at the drop of a hat.

287
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,760
It's much harder to buy £10 million of property.

288
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
If you were to buy

289
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,320
£10 million of property, you would then have to manage

290
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,000
these properties.

291
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
You'd have to worry about tenants, worry about rent.

292
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,520
You have to worry about people's boilers breaking.

293
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,920
It's a hassle, basically.

294
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,760
So what do rich people do?

295
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,360
Well, let me give you an example.

296
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,080
If I had £500,000 cash and I wanted to buy a property,

297
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,720
I could go out and spend £500,000,

298
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,240
buy a flat in London.

299
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,000
£500,000 is kind of roughly

300
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,880
what a flat in London costs nowadays.

301
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,040
I could rent it to my sister and she could pay me

302
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,360
rent every month.

303
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,280
Alternatively, I could lend that money to my sister.

304
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,480
She could go out and buy the house herself,

305
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
and then she could pay me interest every month.

306
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,320
How are these two things different to me?

307
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,080
Well, the first thing I want to point out is,

308
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,480
what is the difference between those two examples

309
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,680
on the housing market and on house prices?

310
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,600
The answer is that is exactly no difference.

311
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,080
You know the housing market doesn't see whether it's me

312
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,160
or whether it's my sister,

313
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,640
whether I'm buying directly

314
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,720
or whether I'm lending to my sister.

315
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,160
All the housing market sees

316
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,080
is somebody’s coming in with £500,000

317
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,280
and buying a house.

318
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,120
So what that shows you is

319
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,080
whether I buy the house directly

320
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,880
or whether I lend the money out to buy the house.

321
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,160
In both cases, I drive the house price up.

322
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,160
The second thing is this question of

323
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,680
who actually owns the house.

324
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
So legally, technically, if

325
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,200
I lent the money to my sister,

326
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
my sister owns the house.

327
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,560
But what is her net worth after she buys it?

328
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,200
Well, she buys a flat that's worth £500,000.

329
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
She has debt of £500,000.

330
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,440
She's worth nothing.

331
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,760
So, essentially, I own the equity in the house.

332
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
So what I'm trying to say here...

333
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
Oh, we should also look at cash flows, right?

334
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
Given that interest rates now are about 5%,

335
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
the amount of rent you would pay if you rented it is

336
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
probably not that dissimilar to the amount of interest

337
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,240
she would pay on borrowing that money.

338
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,200
So really,

339
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
whichever way you cut it

340
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,320
and there are some differences.

341
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,760
Obviously if the house price goes up,

342
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
I prefer to own the house.

343
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,640
The house price goes down. I prefer to be the lender.

344
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,800
But really

345
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
the point I'm trying to make here

346
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,960
is lending money for mortgages

347
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,880
is essentially a way for the rich to buy houses

348
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,720
via the middle class,

349
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,400
and not have to worry about the house price movements,

350
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,280
and not have to worry about managements.

351
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Mortgage lending

352
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,400
and the accumulation of credit by the rich

353
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,800
is the way in which rich people buy houses.

354
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,360
And if you are sitting on a house

355
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
with an enormous mortgage,

356
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,840
realistically you don't own that house.

357
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,120
The person who lent you the money owns that house.

358
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
And it's important to understand this

359
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,680
because as we go forward,

360
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,120
this increased size of mortgage

361
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,600
is going to be the primary way

362
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,520
in which we see the wealth of the middle class decline,

363
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,240
especially here in the UK.

364
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,000
In the UK,

365
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,400
ordinary people tend to hold their assets in property,

366
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
and there is

367
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
and there will be less direct owning of property

368
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,960
by ordinary families.

369
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,360
But what you will see increasingly, is

370
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,200
the government need to keep people

371
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,520
owning property politically.

372
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,880
The rich have this enormous amount of cash,

373
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,760
which is driving house prices up.

374
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
The way that the government can square

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
that circle is to encourage

376
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,080
rich people to lend that money.

377
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,400
And that money gets borrowed

378
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,760
eventually by ordinary people.

379
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,000
And I think this gets disguised somewhat

380
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,080
by the fact that this lending tends

381
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,520
to go through the banking system.

382
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,640
And I think a lot of people assume

383
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,720
that when mortgages go up,

384
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,640
what that means is the bank is accumulating credit.

385
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,600
But remember what I said

386
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,200
at the beginning of this video, that credit and debt

387
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
always equals in society.

388
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,160
So we can go and we can look at any individual

389
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,400
and we can say how much credit do you have?

390
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,600
How much money do you have versus how much do you have?

391
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,160
And you can take the credit and the money.

392
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,600
You can subtract off the debt

393
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,880
and we can work out your total money position.

394
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,600
We can do that to any individual in society,

395
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,880
any company in society.

396
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,560
When we add it up,

397
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
we know it's going to work out to zero.

398
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
If you look at the banks,

399
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,160
the banks do have an enormous amount of credit

400
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
because anyone who has a mortgage owes

401
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,960
money to the bank.

402
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,920
But the bank has also an enormous amount of debt.

403
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,600
And if you look at it,

404
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
you'll find that the debts of banks,

405
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,720
which is money they owe to depositors, money

406
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,320
they owe to lenders such as bondholders of the banks.

407
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,640
These debts, in most cases,

408
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,800
are pretty much the same as the total amount of credit

409
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
they lend out.

410
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
What this means is banks are essentially middlemen.

411
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
They borrow money from the rich,

412
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,840
they lend money to mortgages,

413
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,960
and the mortgage interest goes from you,

414
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,120
the mortgager, to the bank to the rich.

415
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,560
These people are essentially just middlemen in between.

416
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,240
So you need to understand this,

417
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,920
because governments

418
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,800
will see the only way to keep ordinary people in houses

419
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,640
is to encourage

420
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,120
high levels of lending, high levels of mortgages, to

421
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,680
do things

422
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,840
like reduce the checks on mortgage eligibility,

423
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,200
to encourage things like longer term

424
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,320
mortgages, to encourage things

425
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,920
like multi-generational mortgages.

426
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,960
And this is exactly

427
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,000
the transfer of wealth

428
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,480
from the middle class to the rich.

429
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,960
You are getting further and further into debt.

430
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,280
The rich are getting further and further into credit.

431
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,360
They are owning your house via your mortgage

432
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,560
and they are driving you into poverty.

433
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,480
Yeah, I should be clear.

434
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm not saying don't take a mortgage.

435
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,280
I'm not saying don't buy a house.

436
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,360
Ordinary people,

437
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,600
especially ordinary young people, are

438
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,440
put in a situation

439
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,520
where you either have to pay rent to the rich,

440
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,040
or you have to pay interest to the rich.

441
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,240
There's no way of getting out of that

442
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,600
unless your parents are rich

443
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,200
and they can let you live in their house.

444
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,760
You can't really escape this system.

445
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,560
Over time, house prices tend to go up,

446
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,640
which means that financially,

447
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,680
you probably are better off

448
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,320
borrowing as opposed to renting.

449
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,120
But what this means is

450
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,680
your kids will have larger

451
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,240
and larger and larger mortgages.

452
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,680
They will have larger and larger amounts of debt.

453
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,600
You know, it's already normal for an ordinary person

454
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,360
that £500,000 of debt in a mortgage

455
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,320
that will become £1 million,

456
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,800
that will become £2 million.

457
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,880
And that means that your kids

458
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,920
and your grandkids will end up with mortgages

459
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,120
that they can never, ever, ever repay.

460
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,000
And that will be debt owed to the rich,

461
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
and it'll be interest paid to the rich.

462
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,640
And they can use that interest

463
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,400
to push house prices up even further and out

464
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,120
compete your kids for the assets that they need.

465
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,280
This will get worse and worse over time.

466
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,560
That is the nature of compound interest.

467
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,280
I want to be clear. I don't think banks are evil.

468
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,440
I don't think lenders are evil.

469
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,720
I don't think mortgages are evil.

470
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,480
But increased mortgages are debt to somebody.

471
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,720
They are debt to the rich, they will grow and grow.

472
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
This increased debt is the main way

473
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
in which we will see

474
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,520
ordinary families get poorer over time.

475
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,600
The only way to fight it is to rebalance power.

476
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
It's to increase tax on the rich.

477
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,120
It is to decrease taxes on ordinary families.

478
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,720
That's what we campaign for on this channel.

479

480
