1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,840
Okay, welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,600
Today's video is going to be about mental health.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,880
Okay, so when I decide to do these videos, I've

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,040
got a really long Google Doc which has a list of all

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,600
the subjects that I want to do a video about, and

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,200
I've had one on that list about mental health and the

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,400
relationship between mental health and the economy,

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,960
and economy and mental health for a long, long time.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,480
And one of my friends is always

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
telling me I need to make that video, but

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,800
I've put it off for a long time.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,520
Largely because, firstly, I don't like to

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,080
do videos on subjects that are not directly

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,000
related to the economy, and I like to try and

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,080
stay in my lane and be super economy-focused.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,000
And secondly, because, it felt a little bit,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,720
perhaps a bit personal, a bit indulgent.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,160
Anyone who's read my book will know that I've

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,040
had problems with mental health in the past, and

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,760
perhaps I was a little bit unwilling to be one

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,480
of those typical guys on YouTube that starts talking

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,240
about his own mental health in his videos.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,400
But I've decided to do it this week for a couple of reasons.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
The first one is, the last few months

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,160
since I got back from being away,

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,040
I've been doing a lot of videos about

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,960
explaining why we need wealth taxes, how can you

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,160
convince your friends that we need wealth taxes.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,320
And obviously, really, this whole channel is

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
me trying to persuade you and, me trying to

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,720
persuade the public that we need wealth taxes.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,000
And the longer I've been doing that, especially

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
the last couple of weeks, where you put out

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,240
your arguments for wealth taxes and you see

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,360
people coming back with their arguments

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,120
why we shouldn't,

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,360
the more I start to feel that in a way

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
we're not really arguing about the economy at all.

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,200
I think we're putting out this

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
idea into the world, there's massive

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
economic problems, we need to fix things.

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,680
And, often what we get back I

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
think is kind of an emotional response.

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,280
And I think the emotional response we get back

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,400
when we send this message, "The economy is collapsing,"

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
is a pretty understandable emotional response, which

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,240
is that people are scared and people are worried, and

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,560
they don't want the situation to be what I'm saying

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,320
it is, which is that the situation is really bad.

50
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,240
It's getting worse.

51
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,280
The way to deal with it is to work together

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,960
to fight against the richest and most powerful

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,200
people in society, because that's scary.

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,440
And I think really, a lot of what I've been

55
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,120
doing the last few months, these few years, trying to

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,120
convince people we need wealth taxes in the economy,

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,360
a lot of the problem we are having is actually about

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,120
mental health and people who are scared

59
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
about what's happening in the economy.

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,840
And people who, because they are scared, are

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,640
looking for simple solutions and are

62
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,000
unwilling to engage with what we are saying.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
So wanted talk bit about that.

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,000
I wanted to talk about my relationship with that,

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,200
because this is something that I went through

66
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,560
when I first realised these things were happening.

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,080
The second reason why I wanted to do it is because

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,360
I myself have been having a little bit of a difficult

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,320
time, especially the last, say, month or so, mental

70
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
health-wise, motivation-wise, and I thought that meant

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,680
it was a good time to talk about mental health, what

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,600
it means to the economy, what it means for this

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
channel, and what it means about how we fix things.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And thirdly, I've been re-reading one of my

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,960
favorite books recently, which is this book here.

76
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,680
Not being paid by Camus.

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,400
He's dead.

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
This is, The Plague by Albert Camus.

79
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,720
Camus is a French-Algerian author who wrote

80
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,200
this really beautiful book about what it means to live

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,080
in a collapsing society and what that,

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
what that does to us and our mental health.

83
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,520
So yeah, we're going to talk about mental health

84
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,200
today and how that affects the economy.

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
All right, so the first point I want to make, which

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,160
is that the crisis of mental health which we're

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,520
living in, in this country, in the US, across

88
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,680
the world, and the crisis of the economy are super

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,600
related in a way that should be really, really

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,280
obvious, but for some reason is often ignored.

91
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,600
So I went on Question Time this year,

92
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
I think it was maybe in March, and

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,120
the subject of mental health came up.

94
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,280
There's lots of statistics showing

95
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,440
that, especially for young people, like

96
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,880
mental health is really deteriorating.

97
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,840
Lots of people are stressed.

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,000
Lots of people are depressed.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,160
And we were asked, the panel, you know, "Why do you

100
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,120
think people are stressed and depressed?" And,

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,680
one of the ladies on the panel said she thinks it's

102
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
because of mobile phones and social media.

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,520
And you know, perhaps that is a part to

104
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,560
play in it, but it was very frustrating for

105
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,640
me because we live here in a society where

106
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,720
it is increasingly impossible to do like simple things

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
like buy a house and have security for a family,

108
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
be able to get like a decent living environment.

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,400
To get that you need work all the hours God sends.

110
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,520
You need to get a really competitive degree, and

111
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,120
I think it should be really, really obvious that

112
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,160
a big part of the reason why people, especially

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,720
young people, are having mental health problems,

114
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,000
is because it's increasingly impossible just be

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
able to afford the basics of life for most people.

116
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,680
So I think we'll put up a little clip of me

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,240
trying to convince the people on Question Time

118
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,960
that mental health is, is not just because

119
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,520
of phones and it's not just because of individual

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,280
problems, but is related to societal problems.

121
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,000
I think we need to talk about the unbelievably

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,760
hostile circumstances young people face

123
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,800
with regards to their economic futures.

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,960
More and more and more young

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,120
people growing up in poverty.

126
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,480
But even aside from that, we've got

127
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,720
people with jobs in London who are homeless.

128
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,040
So that means if you're a young person, you

129
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,760
know that even if you get an ordinary job,

130
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,680
it's not going to be enough to buy a home.

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,400
It's not going to be enough to have a family.

132
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,240
So, so just doing the right thing,

133
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,640
working and getting job is, it doesn't

134
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,240
even guarantee you can feed your kids.

135
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,280
You know, we have to look at this and then

136
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
obviously, if you're a young person, you're

137
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,760
thinking, "Well, if I don't get the best grades

138
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,000
and I don't get into the best university, then

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm not even going to be able to have a family."

140
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,400
You know, what kind of world have we made here?

141
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,920
You know, we need to look at it...

142
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,280
We always look at the individual.

143
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,320
This person has a mental health problem.

144
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,600
This person has a mental health problem.

145
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,960
It doesn't come out of nowhere.

146
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,840
These people don't just suddenly get sick.

147
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,080
My dad worked for the post office and he had a

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,440
family and he bought a house and he has a retirement.

149
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,920
He has a pension.

150
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,240
Kids can't get that.

151
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,120
Kids can't get that.

152
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
Unless they make millions of pounds,

153
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
they can't even have a family.

154
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
It's ridiculous, you know.

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
It's not just a problem for

156
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,160
individuals, it's a societal problem.

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,400
We need make sure young people have economic

158
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,800
opportunity. It's super, super, super

159
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
frustrating when people treat mental health

160
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,800
problems as if they're like a broken leg.

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,880
Like, you ****** up, you jumped

162
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,200
off a building, you broke your leg.

163
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,680
Now you have a problem.

164
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,320
These things are to do with society.

165
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,880
If you create a society where people have security,

166
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,680
where people can get good quality secure work, and

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,920
that secure work will be able to provide them with

168
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,400
the basics they need to support a family and to

169
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,320
support a family with dignity, then a lot of people

170
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,240
will be relatively happy and calm and relaxed.

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,480
If you create society like we live in now... I live

172
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,640
in a city where people work full-time jobs and are

173
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,880
homeless because they can't afford to pay rent, you

174
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,160
know, nevermind being able to do things like support

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
a family with dignity, get financial security.

176
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,440
People will feel insecure because

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,600
they genuinely are insecure.

178
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,240
And I think it's really, really important

179
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,160
that we start viewing mental health problems,

180
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,400
especially when they exist in societies where

181
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,280
the economic conditions are deteriorating

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,480
really quickly, as being related to the economy.

183
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,080
So, mental health and

184
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,480
the economy are not unrelated.

185
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,520
If you create an economy where people can live well,

186
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
a lot of people will feel secure because they are secure.

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,080
If you create an economy where it's very,

188
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,280
very difficult to get security, people will

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,080
feel insecure because they will be insecure.

190
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
And this relates very much to my own

191
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,120
personal story and, the story of my book.

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,840
So, some of you might not have read

193
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,960
my book so, or know my personal story.

194
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,200
So I made most of my money in 2011 by betting that

195
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,480
basically the... the economic crisis would last forever.

196
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,120
That was just after the 2008 crisis.

197
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,520
And what I bet on was that the economy and

198
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,800
living standards for ordinary people would get

199
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,480
worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.

200
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,120
And I bet on that again,

201
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,400
at the beginning of COVID 2020.

202
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,720
So I'm somebody who has been very aware for a

203
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,480
long time that living standards were going to fall.

204
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,680
And a big part of the story of my book,

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,320
especially the last section of my book,

206
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,360
is very explicitly about

207
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,920
depression and mental health.

208
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,320
And that was me sort of trying to deal with

209
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,960
this recent awareness that I had at

210
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,080
a very young age, in 2011 I was 24, that living

211
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,680
standards were going to get worse forever and

212
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,480
that, there would be big explosions in poverty in

213
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,600
my country, in your country, in the Western world.

214
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,360
And you'd get people who'd read the book

215
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,920
asking me, you know, "So, how did you make your

216
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,400
money?" "Oh, I made my money betting society would

217
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,320
collapse." And then they'd say, "But how did you fall

218
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,360
into depression when you made so much money?" And I

219
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
think it would be like super interesting really that,

220
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,680
that so many people sort of failed to recognise

221
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,320
that, knowing that the society you're in is

222
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,600
collapsing and is going to collapse would have

223
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,360
an effect on an individual's mental health.

224
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,000
The, the little quote at

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
the front of the book, I've got couple.

226
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,200
One of them is from the Japanese film director, Akira

227
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,920
Kurosawa, saying, "In mad world, only the mad are

228
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,120
sane." and this is basically about the...

229
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
What I wanted in this was to point out the fact

230
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,720
that the book is partially about me going mad, but

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
is it a mad thing to do, to go mad when you know

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,840
you're in a society that is about to collapse?

233
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,440
Yeah, that's really what I wanted to talk

234
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,520
about in this video because I think it's

235
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,000
super relevant to our work, trying to persuade

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,680
people they need to take action on inequality.

237
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,080
This question of what does it do to the individual when

238
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,600
they realise they are in a society that is collapsing?

239
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,360
The way that this crisis is often represented

240
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,640
in the media or from politicians is kind of as what

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,080
we call a recession, which means a couple of bad years.

242
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,360
One bad year, two bad years, maybe if you're

243
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,240
really unlucky, three bad years, and then

244
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,760
things will start getting better again.

245
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,120
But the reality is unless you're in the top 10%,

246
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
really this just gets worse and worse

247
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,840
and worse and worse and worse for you.

248
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,520
So, my plan was like, well, listen, this is like

249
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,600
really big political opportunity because the

250
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,080
political status quo works really, really badly

251
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,960
for like 90% of the population, and that means

252
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,880
we have a really good chance here to unite 90% of

253
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
the population to push for something different.

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,560
Like in a democracy, if you have a status quo,

255
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,680
which is going to impoverish the kids and grandkids

256
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,160
of 90% of the population, all you need to do is

257
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,680
show them the truth that this is going to happen,

258
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,640
and you'll be able to motivate them to demand

259
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
something different from their politicians.

260
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,440
And I think the problem with that plan

261
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,480
is really a problem of mental health.

262
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,120
And I'll explain why.

263
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,480
So this concept that what we were actually in

264
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,000
economically was a structural crisis of growing

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,240
inequality, that the bottom 90% was having their

266
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,160
wealth kind of aggressively out by the

267
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,360
top 1%, that is something that I realised in 2011

268
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,720
when I was working as a trader.

269
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,520
At the time, my job was basically to predict

270
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
and bet on the future strength of like nations.

271
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,600
So the UK, the US, Europe, these kinds of things.

272
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,240
And it's a funny job in a way because

273
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,760
if you think that the economy is going to be really

274
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
bad and the economy turns out to be really bad,

275
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,160
then you make money betting on terrible things.

276
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,880
But that is your job, so it's this kind of strange

277
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,760
job which is slightly dehumanised in a way.

278
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
Like if you think a bad thing's going to

279
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,640
happen, your job is to bet that bad thing is

280
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,080
going to happen, and you're kind of encouraged

281
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,880
to think abstractly, step outside the box.

282
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,600
And, if you get it right, you make a

283
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,440
ton of money and nobody really questions like

284
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,040
whether it's the right or the wrong thing to do.

285
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,280
And it felt like a very natural thing

286
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,160
to do for somebody who studied economics.

287
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,440
So, I did economics undergrad at London School of

288
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,040
Economics, and then went into an economic analysis job.

289
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
Your job is to look at economies, analyze economies,

290
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
make predictions, bet on those predictions.

291
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,800
So when I first put this bet on, I didn't really on

292
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,880
any conscious level think, "What does it mean to bet

293
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,640
on a collapsing economy?" Like I was a young person,

294
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,880
this was my job, I was trying to make money.

295
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,000
I put the bet on.

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,400
And it wasn't really until the end of

297
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,360
the year... That year, so this was 2011.

298
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,520
At the end of the year when I got paid on the year,

299
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,480
that I started to really think about, "What does that

300
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,760
mean?" And to be honest, what you see in the sort of

301
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,640
latter part of my book is a long period of me having

302
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,000
this, what you might call, like cognitive dissonance,

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,960
which is one part of my brain knows... Well, I

304
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,680
think the first thing say is, when you first put the

305
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,360
bet on, you don't know for sure that you're right.

306
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,280
It's kind of, you're confident, you're confident enough

307
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,000
to bet on it, but you're not sure it's going to happen.

308
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,360
Then at the end of 2011, I was Citibank's

309
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
most profitable trader in the year that year,

310
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
based on betting society would collapse.

311
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,240
And you get paid a ton of money.

312
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,400
And I think that's probably where like part

313
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,680
of you starts thinking, "Is that like, okay?

314
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Like, should that be the way the world

315
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,760
works?" Like, should you just be paid

316
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,000
a ton of money if the world's going to collapse?

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,120
Should you do anything about the economy collapsing?

318
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,360
But I think this is really the big question,

319
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
which was, you know, my plan is to show people the

320
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
economy is collapsing and hope they will take action.

321
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,000
But when I myself realised the economy was

322
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,400
collapsing, it was a long time before I took action.

323
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,440
And it started a sort of battle in myself where

324
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,280
first of all, you just kind of...

325
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,000
You don't want to accept it.

326
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
You don't want to... Because I think if you

327
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,960
were to accept it, it would demand action from you.

328
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,080
So for me as somebody who had made millions

329
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,480
of pounds betting on society collapsing,

330
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,120
I think there's a pretty obvious moral case to

331
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
make to somebody like that, that is like, "Well,

332
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,080
maybe you should stop the economy from collapsing."

333
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,800
But obviously to do that, I would have had to quit

334
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,680
my job, and I was making an enormous amount of money.

335
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,120
That would be scary.

336
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
Like, I worked really, really hard to get that job.

337
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,080
I came from a poor background, so walking away

338
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,160
from like such a well-paid job was a big thing.

339
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,280
But also like, what do you do?

340
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,600
Like, how can you actually stop this?

341
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,720
And you have these arguments towards the latter

342
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,360
part of the book, where I'm sort of arguing with other

343
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,120
guys at Citibank, my colleagues saying, "Maybe we

344
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,400
should do something." There's one specific discussion

345
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
with, a guy who in the book is called Arthur,

346
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,720
where I say to him, like, "Do you think we should

347
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,960
do something about the collapsing economy?" And,

348
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,680
he thinks I mean like, "Do you think we should put

349
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,440
a trade on?" He just keeps saying, "But you already

350
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,120
put the trade on." And I keep saying, "Should we

351
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,200
do something?" And he just doesn't understand it.

352
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,440
And I think what you kind of see here

353
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,400
is basically when you confront somebody

354
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,920
who is working really hard, leads a stressful

355
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,720
life, has worked hard to get the job that they're

356
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,960
in, or is struggling to put food on the table,

357
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,440
anybody, you say, "Hey, society is collapsing.

358
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,120
Let's stop it," I think a very, very normal

359
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,400
emotional human response is to say like, "**** you.

360
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I'm busy.

361
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm stressed.

362
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Don't come and tell me we need

363
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,120
save the world, because not my job.

364
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
That's the job of the politicians.

365
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,880
Other people should be doing that." And I think a

366
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,560
lot of the pushback that we get, that I get

367
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,720
is basically from people who are kind of struggling

368
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,160
emotionally with the same thing I struggled

369
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,240
emotionally with for a long time, which was, "Oh, ****,

370
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,400
the society we live in is collapsing.

371
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,920
What the **** do we do?" And I think this kind of

372
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,960
debate which I had in my head or in my heart or

373
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,480
in my body sort of in 2011, 2012, and I didn't

374
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,760
finally quit that job till 2014, is to some degree

375
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,840
the argument that we're having in society now.

376
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,800
Because it was pretty clear to me by 2012 that

377
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,200
what was going to happen was living standards would

378
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,800
keep falling basically forever until we stop them.

379
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,320
But I don't think that became really obvious in wider

380
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,800
society, until maybe the last couple of years.

381
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,920
I think you did start to see this

382
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,480
understanding grow more and more and more.

383
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
I think that's part of the reason why Brexit happened.

384
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
I think that's part of the reason why Trump

385
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,160
got elected both the first time and the second time.

386
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
Now we're sort of moving into this space where

387
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,720
it becomes more and more obvious to everyone

388
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,760
that society is collapsing forever, the economy is

389
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,520
collapsing forever, and people as individuals need to

390
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,800
basically decide, "Okay, what do I do with that?

391
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,080
How do I deal with that?" And

392
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,160
this is where Camus comes in.

393
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
So I think this book, this book... Camus,

394
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,440
a French Algerian author, he lived in France

395
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
during the Nazi occupation of France, and he saw

396
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
the rise of the Nazis in the mid-20th Century.

397
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,400
And the book is about an epidemic

398
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,640
of plague in a city in Algeria.

399
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a metaphor for, for fascism and for

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,840
the Nazis and the growth of Nazism in Europe.

401
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,720
But what he talks about is when you live

402
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,680
in the society that starts to collapse,

403
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,840
what do people... how do people react

404
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,440
to that, and how should people react to that?

405
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,960
And in the book, what you see is, basically

406
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,360
most people just kind of freak the

407
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,080
**** out and kind of lose their minds.

408
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,440
And I'm not going to criticise that response at all

409
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,080
because, that's basically what happened to me.

410
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,280
I had basically a breakdown

411
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,800
when I realised society was collapsing.

412
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,600
I realised it a long time before everybody else.

413
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,000
I've had about 14 years to come to terms with it now.

414
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,200
And you see some people become extremely religious.

415
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,120
Some people become extremely angry.

416
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,440
Some people become violent.

417
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,920
Some people become greedy.

418
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,480
A lot of people become hedonistic.

419
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
And I think it's super, super

420
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,840
understandable, this is a reaction.

421
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,120
And when I put my message out there into the

422
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,280
world on the videos saying, "Listen, if we

423
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,920
don't take action, society is going to collapse,"

424
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,520
a lot of the responses I get back

425
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
are basically... And, you know, people say, "Oh,

426
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,080
the pro- but the actual solution is Bitcoin.

427
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,040
What you actually need to do is to print money.

428
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,280
You know, the problem is actually immigrants.

429
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
The problem is actually foreigners." What

430
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,240
I really hear is a lot of people saying,

431
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,440
"Listen, I'm ******* stressed enough as it is.

432
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,640
Don't you dare tell me that this is my problem and

433
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,880
I need to fix it." The best example of that

434
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,440
was I gave a speech at like a really fancy,

435
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,600
advertising company once, and I was on a panel.

436
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,000
And I did this thing that I do where

437
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,280
I say, "Listen, actually we have this

438
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,560
fundamental problem with inequality.

439
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,040
It's going to get worse and worse.

440
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,520
If we don't take action, society will collapse."

441
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
And, um... a lady went up after me and

442
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,280
I think by all accounts, she's a very nice lady.

443
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,240
And what she said was, "Listen, the economy

444
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,720
is part of God's plan and it's like nature.

445
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,280
It's like the changing of the seasons.

446
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,640
Sometimes it gets better and sometimes it gets

447
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,280
worse." And, this was very frustrating for

448
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,280
me in this room full of rich people because

449
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,360
if these people can persuade themselves

450
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,600
that inequality is part of God's plan,

451
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,160
that sometimes it gets better and sometimes it gets

452
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,120
worse, that is a very, very good way of convincing

453
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,040
themselves that they don't need to take action.

454
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,960
And I think a lot of what we are seeing at the

455
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,000
moment is people starting to realise their society

456
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
is collapsing and desperately trying to find a

457
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,000
story to tell themselves, "I'm going to be okay.

458
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,120
I don't need to take action.

459
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,880
I don't need to be responsible for fixing this."

460
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,560
So, the truth is, what we are selling here

461
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,080
on this channel is the truth, but it's not

462
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,280
the most promising choice, right?

463
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,440
Because what we are saying is

464
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
we have a society-wide economic problem.

465
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,120
The problem is being caused by the very rich.

466
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,040
The people who are supposed be fixing it,

467
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,480
the politicians, the economists, are kind of

468
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
incompetent, kind of a little bit bought.

469
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,920
They're not going to fix it.

470
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,120
The job and the responsibility falls on you, ordinary

471
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,720
people, to unite together to educate one another

472
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,600
so that you can push back and fight against the

473
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,800
richest and most powerful people in society.

474
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,120
I think we have to accept that especially in the

475
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
very individualistic societies we live in here in

476
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,400
the UK, US, that is not the most appealing message.

477
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
And we're not the only guys selling a message

478
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,640
about, "How do you fix this?" There are a

479
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,080
lot of other messages online that's saying

480
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
there are other ways to fix your poverty.

481
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm going to show you one now from a Instagram

482
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,120
account I've been really enjoying lately.

483
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,960
Listen to this.

484
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,800
Slaves worked all the hours they were awake

485
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,920
for their entire lives.

486
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,120
I think, like, if they can do it, so can I.

487
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,360
You know, Aldous Huxley once said that a

488
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,320
really efficient totalitarian state would

489
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,040
be one with slaves who do not have to be

490
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,840
coerced because they love their servitude.

491
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,440
The reason I wanted show you that is because

492
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,480
as we move further and further and further into this

493
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,920
collapsing economy, and more and more people lose

494
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,320
their minds, people are going to look for ways to get

495
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,600
out of this that they think can protect themselves.

496
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,360
And I think one thing that is super

497
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,920
interesting about this is one of the other

498
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,280
big solutions that people being sold is if you

499
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,960
just work harder, if you work really, really,

500
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,680
really, really, really, really hard, maybe you

501
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,840
will survive the collapse of your whole economy.

502
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,080
And I think it's... it's really appealing

503
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
in this post-Thatcher/Reagan world.

504
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,800
There was a quote which, Jack, my

505
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,200
cameraman, told me from Margaret Thatcher.

506
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
She said, "Economics are the method.

507
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,320
The object is to change the soul."

508
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,640
And I think that maybe 50 or 60 years ago, we might

509
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,000
have lived in countries where people understood

510
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,120
that the best way to protect your interests

511
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,640
from the rich is to work together.

512
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,280
But as we've moved into very sort of individualistic

513
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,840
mindset, people have been increasingly convinced

514
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,520
that the best way to protect yourself from

515
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,040
the rich is to work really, really, really,

516
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,720
really, really, really, really, really

517
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,400
hard and to compete with other poor people.

518
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,960
If you do that, if everybody does that, if

519
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,040
everybody works really, really, really, really hard to

520
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,760
be the best and lowest paid and hardest working slave,

521
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,520
all you will do is push wages down incredibly quickly

522
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,440
and impoverish yourself and everyone around you.

523
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
The only way to fix this is

524
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,280
to find ways to work together.

525
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,880
Okay, so what do you do if you're in that situation,

526
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,560
if you're in a society that is collapsing?

527
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,480
The rich are taking everything.

528
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,600
The 90% are being killed.

529
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,560
The only real way to stop it is to try and unite

530
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,400
that 90% somehow, or as many of it as you can.

531
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,960
But you live in this

532
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
phenomenally individualistic society.

533
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
Okay, so I'll talk about what I did.

534
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,240
And the truth is, you know, I kind of had

535
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
a mental breakdown basically, and this is

536
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,480
the story of the latter part of the book.

537
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,440
I think it's quite beautifully written

538
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,640
personally, but you can read it if you're interested.

539
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,880
And I tried really, really hard to

540
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,080
convince myself that this was not my problem.

541
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,360
There's a side character in my book who,

542
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,440
I wanted to include more, but I didn't have space.

543
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,400
There's a guy called... In the book, he's called Hong.

544
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,840
Really, really nice guy, maybe not the best trader.

545
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,040
But he did this amazing thing, which

546
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,000
is he used to take like 30 sick days a year.

547
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,840
And another guy who I used to work with

548
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,160
called Billy had a little book where

549
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,560
he used to record all of his sick days.

550
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
That was on top of his 25 holiday days.

551
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,520
And, nobody got really pissed about

552
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,760
this because he was such a nice guy, and,

553
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
he had managed to do this thing in his work

554
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,880
where he had kind of emotionally detached himself

555
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,160
from his work, and he wasn't making the most

556
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,720
money as a trader, but he was a really nice guy.

557
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,000
He was doing his job pretty well, and

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,560
he had managed to be emotionally detached.

559
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,120
And I used to sit on my desk on Citibank

560
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
trading floor, and I used look at this guy.

561
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,320
In the book, he's called Hong.

562
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
This is the scene I wanted to include in the book.

563
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,000
And I used to say to myself, "Why

564
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,360
can't you just be more like Hong?

565
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,160
Why can't you not give a **** about being the best

566
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,720
trader, not give a **** about the world collapsing?

567
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,160
Just get paid your half a million pound

568
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,880
a year and live a ******* good life."

569
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,160
And I tried and I tried and I tried for a long

570
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,680
time, to ignore this sort of, I guess, this

571
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,720
social responsibility to try and fix things.

572
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,320
And then when I tried speak to traders

573
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,960
around me, you know, "Should we do things?"

574
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,640
They just sort of laughed, you know.

575
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,800
Because obviously there's no... You can't pick

576
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,040
up the phone and speak to David Cameron and say,

577
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,960
"The economy's collapsing." And they

578
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
said, "It's impossible to do anything." And,

579
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,640
I told myself it was impossible to do anything.

580
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
And the truth is, you know, I made this realisation

581
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,000
in 2011. I didn't quit 'til 2014.

582
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,840
I tried really, really, really, really hard

583
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,960
to not do anything about the collapsing economy.

584
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,560
But eventually, the truth is, my body kind

585
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,920
of made the decision for me, and, I got more

586
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,640
and more depressed, and I got more and more sick.

587
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,960
And I didn't really get better until I chose to

588
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,080
quit that job and try and ******* do something.

589
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,520
So personally, I think, and I think this is

590
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,960
the message that Camus comes across in his book,

591
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,280
in a society that is collapsing,

592
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,520
the only way to be healthy and to be calm is

593
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,480
to try to do something to stop that collapse.

594
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,080
But the truth is, even when I did quit in

595
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,920
2014, I didn't work very aggressively, at

596
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,120
fixing the collapsing economy for a long time.

597
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,320
This YouTube channel was started in 2020.

598
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,880
So I haven't spoken much about the

599
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,680
period between me quitting my job in 2014

600
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,520
and me starting this YouTube channel in 2020.

601
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,560
And people who read my book, I kind of wanted

602
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,080
give the impression that I never really wanted

603
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
to work for charity and it was kind of like

604
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,640
a game I was using get out of the bank.

605
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,160
But the truth is, that whole period, 2014 - 2020,

606
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,120
I was working in trying to find ways

607
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,840
to stop the economy from collapsing.

608
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,840
And the first thing I did, which I think is

609
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,880
kind of the logical thing to do if your plan is

610
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,720
try and do something about growing inequality,

611
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,280
is I went and I researched the political Left.

612
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,720
It's a common, conspiracy that I'm some sort of

613
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
leftist, some massive leftist, some massive communist.

614
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,840
But the truth is, I was never on the political

615
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,600
Left and, I never voted for Labour,

616
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,720
at the point of leaving my job.

617
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
But because I thought the problem

618
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,880
was inequality, I assumed the political

619
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,160
Left would be the right place to go.

620
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,080
And I started research the political Left

621
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
and I volunteered at some think tanks.

622
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,280
And, you know, I met some great people

623
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,880
who I do still talk to today.

624
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,280
But I was actually like often very,

625
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,720
very frustrated at, number one,

626
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,000
there was almost nobody working on inequality.

627
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,840
And number two, there were a lot of sort of very

628
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,120
posh, well-meaning people who didn't seem super, super,

629
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,480
like really actively concerned and aggressive

630
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,920
about working really hard try and fix inequality.

631
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:40,160
And I think this is another sort of mental health

632
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,440
wall you can hit when you try to fix things, which...

633
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,280
And we see this a lot, which is people watch our

634
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,200
videos, they become convinced like I was convinced,

635
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,640
and they're like, "Oh my God, I want to do something.

636
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,240
I want to help." But they, similarly to

637
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,760
me in that period of time, they don't know where

638
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,360
to go, they don't know where to use their energy,

639
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,480
they don't know how to actually take action.

640
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,160
So, this is a kind of next step from a mental health

641
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,440
perspective, which is you've realised what's

642
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,960
happening, you've had your freak-out, you've gone

643
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,480
mental for a bit, you've managed to calm yourself down.

644
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,840
You're like, "Now I want to help," and

645
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,400
you can't actually find a place to help.

646
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,080
So, I think with regards to this, I'm always...

647
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,400
We have this discussion quite a lot on

648
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,000
the channel, where we, we talk about like

649
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,880
should we get people to send letters to their

650
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,640
MPs or should we give them like calls to action?

651
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,560
Should we arrange like a march?

652
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,040
Should we arrange like rally?

653
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:39,120
And I've always been on the side of, I don't want to

654
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,240
arrange these kind of big grandstand events.

655
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,040
What I want to... Because we're not...

656
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,360
I don't want people to give everything, get

657
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,640
super excited, and then burn themself out

658
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,600
because we haven't built those structures.

659
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,920
So what I would say is if you do want to help

660
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,240
and you're in that sort of space, recognise it's

661
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,040
a long-term battle, recognise it's not all on you.

662
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,280
We are not able to give jobs and work

663
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,080
to everybody who wants to support.

664
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,680
What we would ask you to do is always

665
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
watch and understand the videos, share the

666
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,680
videos, share the message, get good at explaining

667
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,560
in a simple way that the reason the economy is

668
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,440
getting worse is because of growing inequality,

669
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,280
and just build that message, build that message.

670
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,240
If you're an ordinary person,

671
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,400
that's all we would ask of you.

672
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
If you are somebody who is in some position

673
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,440
of power, like you... you are on the political

674
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
Left or you are on the political Right, I

675
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
think you should be asking yourself, how can

676
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,720
you create spaces for other people to get

677
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,560
involved so that they can support this message?

678
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,480
But the final big realisation that I made in that

679
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,640
period when I was trying to figure out ways to fix it

680
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,440
was basically that the fire engines are not coming.

681
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,920
So, there are these institutions in society that are

682
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,520
supposed to protect us from economic collapse,

683
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,560
which are most obviously the politicians, but also

684
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,520
the academic economists, institutions like central

685
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,320
banks, which are full of economists that are supposed

686
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,120
protect your country's economy, things

687
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,200
like the civil service, things like the media.

688
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,480
These guys are all supposed to

689
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,960
realise there is an economic collapse.

690
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,960
And the big thing that I realised after leaving

691
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,400
the bank is that basically these institutions are all

692
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,920
kind of broken and not able to recognise that basically

693
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,880
what is happening is being caused by inequality.

694
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,040
And that was kind of the second

695
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,840
big shocking realisation for me.

696
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,360
And it's also another big shocking realisation,

697
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,280
I think for... to give to ordinary people.

698
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,920
The truth is, the institutions that are supposed

699
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,360
to protect your economy are not functioning.

700
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,920
They're unable to realise

701
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,280
that inequality is the core problem.

702
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,160
That's another thing we just need to sit and

703
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,600
take a long breath and think about, because

704
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,960
that means that if you are just a regular person,

705
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,720
the responsibility to protect your family and

706
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,280
your kids' and your grandkids' future falls upon you.

707
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,360
And that is another thing which is going to freak

708
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,160
people out from a mental health perspective.

709
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,080
But I think the way to deal with it

710
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,280
is to understand it, to accept it, and to find

711
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,440
some way that you can contribute fixing things.

712
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,760
Take it easy.

713
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,120
Don't work too hard.

714
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,480
Support us.

715
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,280
If you are able to get yourself into a

716
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,520
position of power, we really, really need to

717
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,400
get this idea better understood amongst people

718
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,640
like politicians, economic academics,

719
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,360
economists, the media, civil servants.

720
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,400
We need these think tanks.

721
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,560
We need these people to understand better.

722
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,800
If you do not deal with growing

723
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,640
inequality, your society will collapse.

724
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,880
And if you are working in one of those spaces or are able

725
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,400
to work in one of those spaces, please try your best to

726
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,480
spread that message so that people can understand it.

727
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,320
So that brings us to where we are now basically.

728
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,320
The message that I want to send across is that

729
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,800
the reality of the situation is really, really bad.

730
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,160
That is a massive opportunity because it is going to

731
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,080
damage 90% of families in my country and your country.

732
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,120
If we can unite those families, we can

733
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,560
definitely create change politically.

734
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,040
But it is a massive blow to tell people that

735
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,560
that is going to happen, and we need to find ways

736
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,480
to support each other to get people to understand

737
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,960
what's happening and not freak the **** out.

738
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
And that's true for me as

739
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,800
well, and it's true for you.

740
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,480
Listen, I've known for 14 years now

741
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,920
that our economy was going to collapse, and,

742
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,600
the truth is like for the last three years

743
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,400
I've known we had a real opportunity, a really

744
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,040
big opportunity to build something big here.

745
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,160
I'm really proud of what we've built.

746
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,680
I have probably pushed myself a bit too hard.

747
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,240
I took six, seven weeks off earlier this

748
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,640
year, and I came back, and I was really

749
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,600
sort of gunning for it, ready to sort of

750
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,240
go and hold the politicians to account.

751
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,840
And, I've been meeting people at think tanks.

752
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,600
I've been speaking to politicians and celebrities

753
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,960
and trying to build... trying to build a bigger

754
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,120
social media infrastructure for these sort of ideas.

755
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,640
But for the last few weeks, I've been really

756
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,840
struggling a little bit just to make videos, just

757
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,880
to sort of find the creativity to make good videos.

758
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
It's a funny thing for me because my background is

759
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
maths and economics, and, I'm always really, really,

760
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,360
really confident with the economics understanding.

761
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm really confident at trading.

762
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,360
But this YouTube and also the book,

763
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,880
it's not just about understanding the economy.

764
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,960
A huge part of it is this kind of creative

765
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,920
job of how do you package it, how do you make

766
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,120
it compelling, how do you draw people in?

767
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,040
And it's really, it's that kind of creative

768
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,520
energy that I've been struggling a little bit

769
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,120
with recently, and it's, it's the first time

770
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
that's ever really happened to me, to be honest.

771
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
When I wrote the book, it was kind of amazing,

772
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,200
I could just... it took a long time for

773
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,680
me to figure out the shape of it, but once

774
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,320
I had that, it just really flowed through.

775
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,520
And for the last sort of two, three years, I've taken

776
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,600
these big breaks, but I've felt really, really

777
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,080
confident about the creative product we've been making.

778
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,320
And especially the first half of this year,

779
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,360
I thought the videos were amazing, and I really

780
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,280
wanted come back and really hit the ground running

781
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,880
with videos, but I'm honestly just starting

782
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,800
to feel like I'm a little bit running on empty.

783
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,560
And that, and that's been difficult for me.

784
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,520
But I think I've got my

785
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,680
plan for what I'm going to do.

786
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,480
I'm going to mix up videos a bit.

787
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,560
You might find this surprising.

788
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,120
I hate talking to camera, and if

789
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,160
you look at the older videos we used to do,

790
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,240
I used to do a lot of videos where I would talk

791
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,800
to, my mate Simran used to stand over here, and,

792
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,320
I found those videos way, way easier to make.

793
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,640
I think I might need to basically

794
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,480
reduce a little bit my shoot days, and

795
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,680
only do some to camera and do some off camera.

796
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,080
I think I'm going to have to do that

797
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,480
basically in order to slow things down.

798
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,080
It's disappointing for me because,

799
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,400
I really feel like we're sort of, we're

800
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,040
really getting close to building something.

801
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,520
But I can only carry as much as I can carry, and,

802
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,480
basically I need you guys to do a little bit more.

803
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,440
I need especially... If you are somebody

804
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,320
who has influence in one of those spaces,

805
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,240
the political left, the political right,

806
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,360
government, politicians, media, civil servants,

807
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,400
academia, I really need you guys to start

808
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,720
carrying it a bit more and push it a bit more.

809
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,000
Because I don't think I'm going to be able to keep

810
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,320
pushing it as much as I have been the last few years.

811
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,040
But I'm not going to take a break.

812
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,480
We're going to keep shooting at least

813
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,360
for another couple of months.

814
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,920
Look, the strategy is simple.

815
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,080
If we've got enough people, we don't need

816
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
individuals to throw themselves at the barricades.

817
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,640
We don't need individuals to burn themselves out.

818
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,480
Understand the message, spread it, bring people in.

819
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,640
But we also need to build models of

820
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,720
strength that aren't just about individualism,

821
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,600
people being the best, people being richest.

822
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,920
Because the problem is here is really quite simple.

823
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,440
If we can find enough people in this country,

824
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,640
in your country, who are willing to be unselfish

825
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,080
enough that they don't prioritise just their

826
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,520
interests, but they work together to build and

827
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,920
spread a simple message, then their financial

828
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,160
interests will be protected in the long run.

829
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,920
If we are a country that is too selfish, that it

830
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,880
cannot find enough people to protect their collective

831
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,080
interests, then most people will be bankrupted.

832
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,560
So it's kind of this beautiful irony in

833
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,120
a way, which is if people are so

834
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,520
blinded by their selfish material interests,

835
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,080
then they will be materially bankrupted.

836
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,280
But if enough people can stand together to work

837
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,600
together to protect their joint material interests,

838
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,440
then their material interests will be protected.

839
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,320
So it's a battle in a sense

840
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,280
for the soul of the country.

841
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,680
I know which side I'm going to fight on.

842
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,120
I hope you fight too.

843
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,840
You know, I've mentioned Margaret Thatcher in this

844
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,040
video, and she said once, "There is, no such thing

845
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,440
as society." I think what she meant by that was

846
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,040
it is the job of all of us to simply protect ourselves.

847
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,120
The problem is we are in a competition for

848
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,480
resources here, and if we deal with this

849
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,880
in a series of one-on-one battles,

850
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,000
then basically the rich will take everything.

851
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,920
So if we live in a society of individuals

852
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,080
where nobody helps each other, where nobody protects

853
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,120
each other, then who protects the poor from the rich?

854
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,680
So that's it basically.

855
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,720
My video on mental health.

856
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,440
I think it's difficult to be mentally well

857
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,040
when you're in society that's falling apart,

858
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,680
especially a society that tells us

859
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,800
our individual responsibilities are only to

860
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,520
ourselves, but makes it almost impossible

861
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,960
for us protect ourselves individually.

862
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,880
I think the way for us to stay

863
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,280
mentally healthy is... is to fight back,

864
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,800
but to fight back in a way that is balanced.

865
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,240
Don't burn yourself out.

866
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,280
Support each other.

867
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,560
You're going to need each other.

868
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,680
All right, that's it for this week.

869
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,960
We're going to do some more,

870
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,480
off-camera stuff I think.

871
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,200
I've got a couple of good ones coming up.

872
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,800
One about how to build a wealth tax in

873
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,080
terms of implementation, and one about

874
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,200
why you need to forget about money.

875
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,160
Yeah, we're going to try some

876
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,440
new sort of video styles out.

877
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Let us know what you think when you see them.

878
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,280
That's it.

879
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,160
Thanks for your support.

880
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Tax wealth, not work.

881
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,560
Thank you.
