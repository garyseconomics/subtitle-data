This repo contains subtitle files in SRT format that are uploaded to the YouTube channel that are curated by a human editor so they are top quality.
The <https://github.com/garyseconomics/transcripts> repo contains these files plus auto-genrated subtitle data that is processed into a website.
Please contribute to that repo.
