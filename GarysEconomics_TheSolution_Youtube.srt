1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Okay. Welcome back to Garys Economics.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,520
Today

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,320
we are finally going to explain

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,160
how we can stop the economy from collapsing.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,520
Okay, so in the last couple of months,

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,120
I've been on tour.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,280
I've been up and down the country a couple of times,

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
we've had a massive press campaign,

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,840
so I've been all over the TV, radio, the internet,

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
basically explaining that the economy is collapsing,

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
that it will continue to collapse,

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
and that ordinary families

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,840
will be driven into poverty,

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,720
that our kids and our grandkids

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,400
won't be able to afford homes and financial security.

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,320
And,

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,600
we've been getting a lot of press,

18
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,480
and that has obviously been

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,880
basically worrying a lot of people,

20
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,000
people should be worried because this is happening.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
And people are asking me, okay, Gary, what can we do?

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,680
How can we stop that?

23
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,440
And, I’ve

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,320
spent quite a lot of time explaining the problem,

25
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,680
but perhaps not so much explaining

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,800
what we can do to stop the problem.

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,480
So today, what I'm going to try my best to do

28
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,080
is explain

29
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,840
really clearly, as much as possible

30
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,920
from the ground up,

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,200
how I think we can stop

32
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
this economic collapse from happening.

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,560
All right.

34
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,480
So the very first thing we need to do

35
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,800
is just recap very quickly what the economic problem

36
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,920
actually is in its most basic terms.

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
And I'm going to try to explain that

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
in a simple diagram, which I'm going to draw here.

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,760
Okay. So we've got these four groups in society.

40
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,600
We've got the working class,

41
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,120
we've got the middle class,

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,000
you've got the government and we've got the rich.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,440
Now for most of history and in most of the world today,

44
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,600
pretty much all of the wealth in society,

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,720
the land, the property, the natural resources,

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,160
the businesses are owned by the rich.

47
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,440
But for a period of time after the Second World War,

48
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,280
we had a situation where basically all of these groups

49
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,840
held a decent amount of wealth.

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,240
So in my parents generation,

51
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,160
it was normal for even working class families

52
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,560
to have a pension

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,400
and own their own property, for example.

54
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,120
So we had a period where all of these groups

55
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,640
had a decent amount of wealth,

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,960
but the rich had more,

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,160
and especially after their taxes were cut in the 80s,

58
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,040
they started to accumulate more and more.

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
And that meant that

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,480
when other groups in society

61
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,600
wanted to access this wealth, wanted to use this

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,080
wealth, wanted to use

63
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,280
housing, property, natural resources,

64
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,800
buildings, they had to pay

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
rents, profits, dividends to the rich,

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,320
and wealth started to flow

67
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,000
away from these other groups and towards the rich.

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,120
And these flows

69
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,880
really started to increase,

70
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,080
especially during the 2008 crisis

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
and during the Covid crisis.

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,760
And it led to a situation where really

73
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,960
there was very large scale transfer of wealth,

74
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,640
and that is still ongoing.

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,400
And the end result

76
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,080
was that the working class lost pretty much

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
all their wealth and got into a bit of debt as well.

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,960
The government is now massively in negative wealth,

79
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,640
so they've only got debt.

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
And the middle class,

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,760
they kept some of their wealth, but not so much.

82
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
The wealth of the rich

83
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,680
just got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,

84
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,120
especially during Covid.

85
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,160
What this meant was

86
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,880
because these groups of society,

87
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,920
who traditionally are the big spenders

88
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,360
in terms of proportion of their wealth,

89
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,280
were losing their wealth.

90
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,880
Spending fell, wages fell

91
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,440
and because these guys have much more wealth now

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
and these guys have less

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
these transfer payments

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
which you have to make to

95
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,720
use wealth, access resources, went up

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,080
because you've got less resources now they've got more.

97
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,920
So you need to pay to use

98
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,080
a greater amount of resources.

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,680
So these flows increased.

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,960
And now we're in a situation

101
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,160
where basically these groups are basically wiped out.

102
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,280
The working class has basically nothing left.

103
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
These guys already live

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
in increasingly desperate poverty.

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
The government is, like, totally bankrupted,

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,640
they're out.

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,440
And the middle class has just this little bit left,

108
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
which they're hanging on to,

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
but it's gradually being sucked out.

110
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,600
And, before long, they will be gone too.

111
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
And then you end up in this situation

112
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,160
where basically the rich own everything.

113
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,560
You have no middle class, nobody else owns anything.

114
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,760
And an economy like that looks like,

115
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,920
looks like Nigeria, looks like India, looks like Brazil.

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,880
And basically you have very broad poverty.

117
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
If you want to fix this,

118
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,320
you need to get wealth flowing back

119
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,920
in the other direction.

120
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
And, there are different ways to do this.

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,320
In theory, you can do it without taxes.

122
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,440
And if you are interested in non-tax solutions

123
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,760
for getting ordinary families their wealth back,

124
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,040
we have a video

125
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,520
called The Wealth Time Limit, which I did years ago.

126
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,640
But realistically,

127
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,800
I think you're only realistic hope

128
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,320
of getting the wealth back in the working class,

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,880
back in the middle class, getting wealth

130
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,600
to flow away

131
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,160
from the rich is, to quote the Dutch historian

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,680
Bregman, “Taxes, taxes,

133
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,600
taxes”.

134
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,320
I do really think this is the only way.

135
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,480
I know it's difficult because the rich will oppose it,

136
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,000
but I think

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,160
unless we can get much higher

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
levels of tax on the rich,

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
I don't think there is any way we can get

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
that wealth back to working

141
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
class and middle class families.

142
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,360
So if we're talking about tax,

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
I always think

144
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
when we are discussing the question of

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
how can we tax the rich more,

146
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,200
tax working families less,

147
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,240
get wealth flowing back to working class families.

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I always think it's really,

149
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,240
really helpful to break that question of tax down

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,840
into two completely separate questions.

151
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
Question one,

152
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,280
what specific changes do we want in the tax system?

153
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,480
And question two,

154
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,160
how do we make

155
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,000
those changes happen.

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
And the reason why

157
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
I think it's really important to separate them

158
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,360
is because these are really

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
just two completely separate questions.

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,760
This number one is a question of...

161
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
really it's a technical question.

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
It's a kind of a, it's a tax

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,880
advisers, it's a tax planners question. It's...

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,400
it's a technical economics question.

165
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,680
And number two is a question of, of power.

166
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,560
It's a question of how do we force these things.

167
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
And the reason why

168
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
I think it's really, really important to separate them

169
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,840
is because we tend to focus very,

170
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,520
very much on this - question one.

171
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,480
Especially when we are talking to

172
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
people like me who are economists.

173
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
We want to say, okay, well,

174
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,000
what are the changes in the tax system?

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,360
What are the change in the tax system?

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
And I think this is

177
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,960
perhaps a little bit naive to the fact

178
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,880
that basically at the moment

179
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,440
we are losing this debate for question two,

180
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
which is at the moment we're not getting any taxes.

181
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,040
at all.

182
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,080
We are increasingly seeing changes in the tax system

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
which tax rich people less.

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,320
Which tax working people more.

185
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,920
That is true

186
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,440
even in countries that have

187
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,640
centre left governments

188
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,280
who you might think

189
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,600
would be more supportive of richer...

190
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,840
of poor people.

191
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,640
It's true here in the UK, we have a Labour government.

192
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,480
It was true under Joe Biden.

193
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,240
We are seeing even under governments

194
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
that are supposed to be left wing,

195
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,800
the inability to raise taxes at all.

196
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,400
So I think

197
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,240
it's really important to recognise

198
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,400
that these two things are separate,

199
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,040
because we can often end up in a situation where

200
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,800
somebody like me is trying to make a very strong case

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,240
for the fact

202
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
that if we don't change the tax system,

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
we will see basically a collapse of society

204
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,040
and somebody who

205
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,720
perhaps is rich or is funded by

206
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,640
the rich will come in and say, “Aha!

207
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,880
But what specific changes do you want to make?”

208
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,320
And they would ask you to sort of sit down

209
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,640
and carefully plan

210
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,040
a brand new tax system right there in front of them,

211
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,000
and then they will say, “Oh, well,

212
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
this specific problem is wrong

213
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,760
and this is not going to work.” Listen,

214
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,000
I am not particularly passionate

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
about the specific form of tax that we take.

216
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,640
I am aware that it is really,

217
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,320
really important that this is carefully designed

218
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,600
to hit the richest rather than the middle class.

219
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,080
I'm totally aware of this problem,

220
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,440
and I'm aware that different

221
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,360
forms of taxes will have different problems.

222
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
And I'm aware that we need to be really, really careful

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
about how we plan it, how we design it.

224
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,600
But the truth is,

225
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,640
the most important thing is that we get a change

226
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,320
and there are a number of forms that change can take.

227
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
I campaign for wealth taxes.

228
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,800
Some people campaign

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
for equalising capital gains with income tax.

230
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,760
Some people talk about closing down the loopholes

231
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,480
that very rich families use to pay zero taxes.

232
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,960
These are all good plans,

233
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,360
but I don't think we should let the perfect

234
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
be the enemy of the good.

235
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,880
The truth is, we are losing

236
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,720
this battle for question two.

237
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,480
And if we lose this battle for question two,

238
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,240
then your family will be bankrupted.

239
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,680
So I came into this game, you know, as an economist,

240
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,520
who thought a lot about question one.

241
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,560
And I kind of became a campaigner. A YouTuber.

242
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,520
I literally taught myself how to write a book,

243
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,280
because I could see

244
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,720
we were going to lose question two.

245
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,920
So I am going to focus

246
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
for the rest of this video on question two.

247
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,360
The only thing I will say about question one is

248
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,840
I think we need to deal with the fact

249
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,400
that some people say

250
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,200
there's no point trying to tax the rich

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
because reducing inequality is impossible.

252
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,400
And the answer to that is 100%.

253
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,240
It is possible because we did it in the 20th century.

254
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,120
In the beginning of the 20th century,

255
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
inequality in this country,

256
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,520
across Europe, across

257
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,720
the United States, was extreme high.

258
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,480
And ordinary families like yours

259
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,200
and mine lived in desperate poverty.

260
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
And over the course of the 20th century,

261
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,920
we reduced wealth inequality really significantly.

262
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
That got wealth into the hands of ordinary families,

263
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,360
and it led to really significant increases

264
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,400
in living standards,

265
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,520
which meant that our parents

266
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,680
and grandparents lived much,

267
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,000
much better lives than people

268
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,160
in the early 20th century did.

269
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
So for now,

270
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,680
we need to focus on getting some form of change,

271
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
because if we spend all of our time

272
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,040
arguing about the specific form of the change,

273
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
we wont get anything at all.

274
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,680
There's no point arguing about battle tactics

275
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,080
until you have an army.

276
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,800
So let's talk about how can we force these politicians

277
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,920
to give us the things that we need. All right, so. I,

278
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,240
as most of you will know, if you've been watching

279
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,640
this channel, was an economist,

280
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,280
mathematician and a trader.

281
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,120
I worked as a trader from 2008 to 2014.

282
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,280
I made a lot of money

283
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,880
by recognising,

284
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,840
basically, exactly the diagram

285
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,440
I showed you at the beginning of the video,

286
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,520
which was that wealth

287
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,840
has, was and still is being drained

288
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,400
out of the middle class, out of the working class,

289
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,040
accumulated by the very rich,

290
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,280
that was going to suck

291
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,680
spending power out of the economy,

292
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
and that was going to impoverish

293
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
most ordinary families.

294
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,640
I bet on that.

295
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,280
And I was very successful

296
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,000
betting that the economy would collapse.

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,440
And I made a lot of money on that.

298
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,200
And I quit trading in 2014.

299
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
I was living in Tokyo at the time,

300
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,240
and I came back to London,

301
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,960
basically with this conviction

302
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,920
that I was right in this relatively

303
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,640
simple economic understanding that we would see

304
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,360
continued further and further

305
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,560
and further worsening of living standards.

306
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,840
And I didn't want that to happen.

307
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,120
I don't want that to happen.

308
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,160
I assume you don't want that to happen

309
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960
because it will mean poverty for you and your kids.

310
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
And my plan was

311
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,440
basically, simply to come back to London

312
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,280
and show people this, this truth.

313
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,040
And I've been spending basically those,

314
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,600
nearly 11 years now since I came back,

315
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
trying to figure out

316
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,760
how can we actually stop this crisis from happening.

317
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,760
And my plan has always been

318
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,240
really relatively simply,

319
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,440
this crisis will impoverish

320
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,400
70%, 80%, 90% of the population here in the UK,

321
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,080
in the US,

322
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,040
in Australia, in Europe, wherever you're watching,

323
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
and you're seeing that happening,

324
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,960
you are seeing larger and larger

325
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,920
percentages of the population being impoverished.

326
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
And it doesn't make sense

327
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
for the public to accept that.

328
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,120
So all we need to do

329
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,360
is show them what's happening,

330
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,680
make it clear to them what's happening,

331
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,920
and they will reject it, basically.

332
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,080
But it's been 11 years now

333
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,120
and we haven't achieved it yet.

334
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,400
So I would like to explain basically how my thinking

335
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,120
has developed and refined into trying

336
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,240
to figure out a way that we can really effectively

337
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,400
stop it.

338
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,440
So when I first came back, the first place I went to

339
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,120
was I worked for an economics

340
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,000
think tank in London

341
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,320
called the New Economics Foundation.

342
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,440
I volunteered there for about six months.

343
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,120
You know, this is a progressive economics 

344
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
think tank in London.

345
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,280
I kind of figured that these would be the guys

346
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,800
who would help you

347
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,360
sort of introduce new economics ideas into society.

348
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
Their name was literally the New Economics Foundation.

349
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,400
And I volunteered there for six months.

350
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
I met a lot of nice people.

351
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,280
Some of them I'm still friends with now.

352
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
But I basically became convinced that they

353
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,120
didn't really have the capacity

354
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,680
to really push this new idea out.

355
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,560
There was very, very little appetite

356
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,680
for ideas and inequality.

357
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,720
They needed to get funding

358
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,000
for all of their individual projects.

359
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,760
And, you know,

360
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,720
they could get a lot of funding

361
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,840
for global warming stuff

362
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
and kind of identity politics stuff.

363
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
But there was basically nobody

364
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
funding wealth inequality stuff.

365
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,960
The space was quite middle class.

366
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,640
So in many cases there weren’t

367
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,400
people who were not themselves being directly hurt.

368
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
I make the point a lot on this channel,

369
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
and I think this is important

370
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,360
to recognise, crises of inequality,

371
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,560
they impoverish 90% of the population,

372
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,320
but they make like 1% or 2% of the population

373
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
absolutely, really bloody rich.

374
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,160
And these guys, they benefit from it.

375
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,640
And there's another sort of 3%,

376
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,680
4% below that that are pretty well protected.

377
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,280
And I sort of found in that think tank space,

378
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,120
a lot of these protected people basically,

379
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,800
and unfortunately whilst

380
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
they are in many cases

381
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
very well-meaning,

382
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,360
I didn't see any chance of getting

383
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,560
change essentially from that think tank space.

384
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,320
So I went then to university, I did a two year

385
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,920
economics master's at Oxford, and,

386
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,840
you could probably imagine

387
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,800
if the think tank space was quite

388
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,400
rich and quite upper middle class, the

389
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Oxford University

390
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,960
was unbelievably rich and middle class.

391
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,240
And,

392
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,120
you know, good luck to anyone

393
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,560
who's trying to make change in academia,

394
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
and we do need people in those spaces.

395
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,000
I became pretty convinced that

396
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,280
academia was almost completely

397
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,320
a dead end at the moment.

398
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,240
I think, you know, we've made videos on this.

399
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,280
I think the situation of university,

400
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,760
especially elite university academic economics, is just

401
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,520
if the situation wasn't so serious,

402
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,240
it would be quite funny, really.

403
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
You've got a lot of very smart kids

404
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,720
that are locked in

405
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,640
tiny, windowless rooms, doing

406
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,320
unbelievably complicated mathematics,

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,680
with absolutely no idea what's happening in the world.

408
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,920
So I don't think that we're going

409
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,600
to make change from those spaces.

410
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,240
I eventually decided

411
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,480
to try and move into the media space.

412
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,680
I made that space in early 2020.

413
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,840
And the idea was basically, you know,

414
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,000
I've spent

415
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
5, 6 years now

416
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,560
trying to convince rich people to deal with inequality.

417
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,120
I don't think they're going to do it.

418
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,920
The people who are affected by and

419
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,880
and hurt by this economic crisis of inequality

420
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,320
are ordinary families, ordinary families like you,

421
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,480
ordinary families like your kids.

422
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,240
And I was hoping that in the media space,

423
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,880
I might be able to basically

424
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,720
speak to the people who are being hurt.

425
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,640
Speak to people who are being affected.

426
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,600
Instead of speaking to,

427
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,280
you know, the rich guys who are benefiting.

428
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,920
And, that is really when I started to develop

429
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,480
the plan that I've been doing the last

430
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,960
four years, especially the last 2 or 3 years.

431
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,760
Which is I genuinely think that the vast

432
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,400
majority of people in this country,

433
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,720
and I think this is true if you're here

434
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,080
or in the States or in Europe or in Australia

435
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,160
do not have a single person

436
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,480
in the mainstream media

437
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,400
who is communicating

438
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,160
effectively, clearly, understandably,

439
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
what is happening in this economic crisis

440
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,960
that is increasingly devastating living conditions

441
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,840
for millions of ordinary families across the world.

442
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,120
And I started to feel that there was a massive gap,

443
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,400
basically a huge gap,

444
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,920
a huge gap to fill, basically telling people

445
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,560
what is happening.

446
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,600
And I started to feel that really strongly

447
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
during Covid,

448
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,680
that basically the quality of our economics media

449
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,640
was extremely low.

450
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,000
The quality of our politics

451
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
from an economics perspective was extremely low.

452
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,400
And we were because of those failures,

453
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,680
we were going to see a continuation of fall

454
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,880
in living standards.

455
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
But we were going to see this

456
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
enormous unmet demand

457
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,480
for somebody who was simply talking about

458
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,840
and explaining

459
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,400
what is actually happening in the economy.

460
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,200
Okay. So let's talk about

461
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,320
what is happening in

462
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,680
economics and politics.

463
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,360
I think you basically have

464
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,960
two strands of economic thought

465
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,760
and two strands of political thought,

466
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,320
which is you have this kind of

467
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,200
old school,

468
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,960
the kind of dominant economic ideology of the last

469
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,360
30, 40 years,

470
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,400
which is really,

471
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,360
I think, personified

472
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,320
by the current Labour government,

473
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,400
which is if

474
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,680
we just do everything a little bit more efficiently,

475
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,440
things will get better.

476
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,320
There's no explicit focus on inequality at all.

477
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,600
They often tend to focus on trying to change the system

478
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,280
in such a way that it benefits the rich,

479
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,320
which means inequality

480
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,200
tends to get worse over time,

481
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,240
and living standards fall for the majority.

482
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,960
While this kind of

483
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,800
semi elite group of politicians and economists

484
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,560
themselves are protected.

485
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,080
And this is really clearly dying.

486
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,360
You can see it in the complete collapse

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,160
in support for

488
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,280
almost all of the traditional centre

489
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,360
left and centre right parties across Europe.

490
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,560
Those parties are only really hanging on in the UK

491
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,440
and the US

492
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,560
under systems

493
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,200
which basically make it

494
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,640
almost impossible to replace them.

495
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,240
And you're seeing them,

496
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,640
you're seeing even in those countries,

497
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,240
those parties become extremely unpopular and die.

498
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,880
That creates this massive, massive gap for new ideas.

499
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,280
So I think we are here in this space now.

500
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,160
There is a massive,

501
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,560
massive popular demand for new ideas.

502
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,960
And really,

503
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,120
the political left has almost completely failed to put

504
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,480
any new ideas on the table.

505
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,360
And that gap is

506
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,480
being filled by

507
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,760
a new political right,

508
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,440
which I think has been very effective

509
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,360
in doing things like utilising social media,

510
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
utilising influencers,

511
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,000
especially on the right

512
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,960
to basically sell a new political story.

513
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,520
And they are, in a sense,

514
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
taking advantage of the exact same thing

515
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,840
which I've just described to you,

516
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,680
which is that politics is...

517
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,880
has failed, media has failed.

518
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,320
There is massive demand for something which is new

519
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,880
because people know that the status quo is failing,

520
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,000
and these guys are filling that gap

521
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,240
with ‘The problem is foreigners.

522
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,640
The problem is immigrants’,

523
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,320
and they will be very successful.

524
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
You know, they clearly have taken power

525
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,760
of the US government.

526
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,000
They will increasingly take control

527
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,240
of European governments.

528
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,000
And they have taken control

529
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,320
of many European governments.

530
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,040
They are successful,

531
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,080
I think, not necessarily because they are

532
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,120
good.

533
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,000
I think simply because no one else

534
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,440
has really tried to occupy that gap.

535
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,680
I think there is

536
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,560
massive demand for a massive potential for

537
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,880
a simple message delivered to working people.

538
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,240
The reason you are getting poor

539
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,680
is because your wealth is being squeezed out

540
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,000
by the rich and the super rich.

541
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,720
They are taking their wealth from you.

542
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,480
You are unable to compete with them.

543
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,040
The working class is being bankrupted.

544
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,200
The middle class is disappearing. Tax wealth not work.

545
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,480
I honestly think we have a chance

546
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,520
of winning power on that.

547
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,040
And I think in this country in the short term, our...

548
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,040
because we have this centrist party in power,

549
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,000
our problem is how do we squeeze the centre on that?

550
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,120
And I think the power we have

551
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,840
is that the centre is number one,

552
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,200
phenomenally unpopular, and number two

553
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
will fail on the economy.

554
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,040
So I think we really have power there.

555
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,640
The longer term risk is not the centre

556
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,560
because I think the centre

557
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,720
will progressively lose popularity,

558
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,120
but these new right ideas.

559
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,200
The problem we have is that they will always be

560
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,120
much, much, much better funded than us.

561
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,440
Quite simply because

562
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,640
once billionaires realise

563
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,840
that the long term battle is a battle between tax

564
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,320
the rich and blame the foreigners,

565
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,800
the billionaires will increasingly aggressively fund

566
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,000
blame the foreigners as an idea.

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But we do also have a kind of trump card against this

568
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,080
new right,

569
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,960
which is

570
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,680
when it comes to economic policy,

571
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,080
almost all of these new right parties

572
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,200
want to slash taxes on rich people.

573
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,080
And I think that's partly ideological.

574
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,920
And I think it's partly

575
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,200
because they're funded by billionaires.

576
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,240
And, you know, that's what the billionaires want,

577
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,280
which means that even in the cases where these guys

578
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,840
do take power, and we've seen it

579
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,080
in some European countries, but,

580
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,280
you know, most obviously

581
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,480
we've seen it recently in the US.

582
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,200
These guys will also preside over

583
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
an increase

584
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
in wealth inequality,

585
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
which will mean, again,

586
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,080
a squeeze of assets away from the middle class,

587
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
away from the working class,

588
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,080
and further falls in ordinary families

589
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,160
living conditions.

590
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,400
So these guys, whilst they will be very well-funded

591
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,640
and they are very clearly in the ascendancy,

592
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
they have a really, really serious weakness,

593
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
which is they are literally

594
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,040
impoverishing their own supporters.

595
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,200
But this is not just the weakness

596
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,280
of the political right.

597
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,680
This is also the weakness of the political centre.

598
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,720
You know, I put a video out

599
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,240
a few weeks ago saying,

600
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,480
Trump and Labour will both fail

601
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,880
because they will both allow wealth

602
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,960
inequality to increase,

603
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
which means the squeezing out of wealth

604
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,200
from ordinary families to the rich.

605
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,040
And as much as,

606
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,880
you know, this movement is small

607
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,800
and it's it's almost completely unfunded,

608
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,000
the power that we have is

609
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,320
both of our competitors are actively impoverishing

610
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,840
their voter base,

611
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,120
aggressively impoverishing their voter base.

612
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,160
So I think we really, really

613
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,640
have a chance

614
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,200
by pushing

615
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,960
a single message

616
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
again and again and again,

617
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,000
wealth inequality is what is making you poor.

618
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,680
The only way to protect your families from poverty

619
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,720
is to get the wealth back from the very rich.

620
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,880
That means fixing a broken tax system

621
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,360
which taxes you at higher rates than them.

622
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,960
It means changing the tax system

623
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,400
to tax them more, to tax you less.

624
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,880
Tax wealth, not work.

625
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,560
Now, I want to make it clear,

626
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,760
because I'm in the business of predictions,

627
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,400
what will happen if we don't get this onto the table.

628
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,520
If we don't get this idea onto the table,

629
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,880
then we will be left with, essentially

630
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,800
the two voices on the table that are already there,

631
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,000
which is one

632
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,960
this kind of tired old centrism where we just say

633
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,440
business, business, business,

634
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,400
growth, growth, growth,

635
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,880
entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship,

636
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,840
entrepreneurship to ourselves again and again

637
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,920
a million times, whilst

638
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,800
we impoverish the working class.

639
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,360
And this new right idea of the problem is immigrants,

640
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,600
the problem is foreigners.

641
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,800
And because you have only two basic ideas on the table,

642
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,560
what you will have is you will get one party in power.

643
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,120
So for example, in this country

644
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,480
we currently have the boring centrists in power.

645
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,680
They will oversee a growth in inequality

646
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,160
and they will become very unpopular

647
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,960
and they will be replaced

648
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,480
by a ‘The problem is foreigners’ party and ‘the problem

649
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,280
is foreigners’ party will also

650
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,880
watch inequality

651
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,000
grow and they will eventually become unpopular

652
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,360
and people will vote the boring centrists in again.

653
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,320
And what you will see

654
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,880
here is

655
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,920
the right wing party ‘the problem is foreigners’

656
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,000
party has space to move into,

657
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,200
which is they can say, okay,

658
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,840
the reason we failed was because we weren't

659
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,200
hard enough on foreigners.

660
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,280
They can rebrand

661
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,480
and they can come in further to the right.

662
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
And this is basically exactly what we saw

663
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
in this country.

664
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,160
You know,

665
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,480
we had

666
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,840
David Cameron, who was this kind of essentially

667
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,800
a boring centrist,

668
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,320
and he was replaced

669
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,360
briefly by Theresa May,

670
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,280
but eventually by Boris Johnson,

671
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,720
who was essentially,

672
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,160
a re flanking to the right of the political right,

673
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
which is, you know, we don't want to...

674
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,920
he really was replacing of a boring

675
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,640
centrist with ‘the problem is foreigners.’

676
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,680
And when he lost he was replaced by,

677
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,280
very briefly

678
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,040
Liz Truss, who again was flanked further to the right.

679
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,600
And when she immediately crashed the economy,

680
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,680
we again got boring centrist Rishi Sunak.

681
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,440
And he was replaced by boring centrist Keir Starmer.

682
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,760
And what you are seeing now in

683
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,040
this country is the growth of Nigel Farage,

684
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,120
who is again the political right

685
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,960
moving to the right.

686
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,320
And you see the same thing in the US.

687
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,280
So in the US you have Donald Trump.

688
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,400
He is a ‘the problem is foreigners’ politician.

689
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,080
He will fail.

690
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,080
He could be followed by another boring centrist,

691
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,880
or he could be followed

692
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,000
by another new sort

693
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,880
of rebranding of the political right,

694
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,640
which is what we need to do is, is be more extreme

695
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,560
on the right.

696
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,920
And,

697
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,800
billionaires will probably be funding these,

698
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,920
these new right wing parties

699
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,560
because they see them

700
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,920
as protecting them from taxing the rich.

701
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,280
And what you’ll see is eventually

702
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,480
these right wing parties

703
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,160
will become more and more extreme,

704
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,320
because it's the only way

705
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,480
you can keep winning elections,

706
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,640
when you keep failing on the economy.

707
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,200
What you are being

708
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,600
popular for is blaming foreigners and immigrants,

709
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
and if you're not succeeding on the economy,

710
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
you can just, you can keep doubling down on that.

711
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
You have space to the right to go into,

712
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,800
whereas the centre kind of have nowhere to go.

713
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
They'll become increasingly unpopular.

714
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,600
So, I think we have to be realistic about this.

715
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,200
That leads you over a period of time

716
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,160
from what might may initially have been sensible

717
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,640
seeming, ‘the problem is foreigners’ politics

718
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,520
closer and closer and closer to real fascism.

719
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
I mean, that is...

720
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,720
that is where it goes.

721
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,160
And I'm not saying Farage is a fascist,

722
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,280
I'm not saying Trump is a fascist.

723
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,920
That is where it will go over time.

724
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,240
This is exactly what happened

725
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,520
in the early 20th century.

726
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,880
That is what will happen

727
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,480
if we do not get a new voice on the table.

728
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,280
And I think it's worth

729
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,160
seeing and thinking about that for a minute,

730
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,200
because I know we,

731
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,760
we live in countries, you know, here in the UK,

732
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,840
but I know we've got a growing US viewership,

733
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,680
we live in countries

734
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,360
where politics is increasingly factional

735
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,920
and people who view themselves as on the left

736
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,720
hate people who view themselves as on the right.

737
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,760
People who view themselves as on the right,

738
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,000
hate people who view themselves as on the left.

739
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The way this will go will be a...

740
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,840
I was going to say slow,

741
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,040
but it could become increasingly quick,

742
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,480
slide into fascism

743
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
whilst both of you,

744
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,520
those of you who view yourselves

745
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,440
as on the left

746
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,880
and those of you who view yourselves as on the right,

747
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,280
will slide further

748
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,800
and further and further into poverty.

749
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,880
So I think it's really,

750
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
really important

751
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,920
that you recognise neither of these groups

752
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,280
are going to give you what you need,

753
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,000
which is your houses back

754
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,280
and your ability to be able to have a family. Okay. So

755
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,920
this is a

756
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,920
fight which I genuinely believe we can win.

757
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,760
Not because we are strong

758
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,680
and not because we are well-funded,

759
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,600
but quite simply

760
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,600
because we are competing with two political ideologies

761
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,400
which are both bankrupting the public,

762
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,600
bankrupting 80%, 90% of the public.

763
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,120
And that makes them

764
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,640
very weak to a campaign

765
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,560
which basically simply reveals

766
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,960
the truth of what is happening,

767
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,080
which is the reason you are getting poor,

768
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,560
is because the rich are eating your cake.

769
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,800
They are squeezing you out.

770
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,000
They are taking your assets.

771
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,920
They're driving a family into poverty.

772
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,280
The power that we have is...

773
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,920
really we've got two powers.

774
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,560
One, we are the only voice

775
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,560
which will protect ordinary people from poverty.

776
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,680
And two, we have strength in numbers.

777
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,840
This is genuinely in the financial interests

778
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,600
of the vast majority of people,

779
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,400
both on the political left and on the political right.

780
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
This works for them financially.

781
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,480
So I genuinely believe this is a fight we can win.

782
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,800
The problem is, we're not fighting it.

783
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,680
There's just not enough people

784
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,960
getting this idea into the public domain.

785
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,440
And I want to talk a little bit about two ideas.

786
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,160
One is the Overton window

787
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,040
and the other is message discipline.

788
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
So the Overton window is an idea in,

789
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,240
I guess, in politics

790
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,000
that there's a kind of window of ideas

791
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,360
which are considered

792
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,840
acceptable, sensible, normal,

793
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,800
non extreme at a given point in time.

794
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,320
We've got some videos on this channel.

795
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,480
Maybe I'll link one in the description

796
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,360
talking about why economists

797
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,920
don't talk about wealth inequality.

798
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,880
The vast majority of economists are rich people

799
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,720
who are not being hurt by this.

800
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,000
They are benefiting from it,

801
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,280
and they do not think inequality is the problem.

802
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,560
That means that at the moment,

803
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,960
focusing on and centralising inequality,

804
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,920
wealth inequality as the core problem,

805
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,320
is not popular with economists,

806
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,200
and it's outside the Overton window.

807
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,320
This really is the key challenge that we have.

808
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,640
And people sometimes ask me, you know,

809
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,680
why don't Labour talk to you?

810
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,560
Why don't Labour get this idea in their manifesto?

811
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:01,280
Really, it comes down to very simply that answer.

812
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,920
This is outside the Overton window.

813
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,480
The group of people in this country

814
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,760
and in most countries across the world who decide

815
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,560
what is acceptable, what is sensible, what is wise,

816
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,560
is a very small group of rich and posh people.

817
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,280
And they've decided that this

818
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,560
idea is simply unacceptable.

819
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,920
We need to push back on that.

820
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,000
But in order to do that, we need message discipline.

821
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,520
So this is the second concept I want to introduce.

822
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,600
Message discipline is again another political idea.

823
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,320
This is the reason why when when politicians go on TV,

824
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
they're always unbelievably, painfully boring,

825
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,800
which is that they get told by their political party

826
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,320
if this subject comes up, you have to say this.

827
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,880
And when they go on the TV,

828
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,320
they're not really thinking, what's my opinion on that?

829
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,240
What do I think about that?

830
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,160
They're thinking,

831
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,520
what has my political

832
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,760
party told me to say about this issue?

833
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,320
And for that reason, when politicians go on TV,

834
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,840
they all say the exact same thing

835
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,000
again and again and again and again and again

836
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,600
and the reason they do

837
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,800
this is this is how you get an idea

838
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,320
into the Overton window.

839
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,320
If you say an idea again and again and again

840
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
and again, and it's important

841
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,880
that a variety of people say it.

842
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,120
And then you guys out there

843
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,680
hear 25 different

844
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,840
posh looking, smart sounding people

845
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,080
saying the same idea ‘the problem is immigrants,

846
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,840
the problem is immigrants,

847
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,720
the problem is immigrants’ on the TV,

848
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,880
then you start to believe that idea.

849
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,400
This is how

850
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,360
an idea goes from being crazy, wacky,

851
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,520
unbelievable, no, no way true, to being common sense.

852
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,800
An idea travels from being absolutely outrageous

853
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,000
to being commonly accepted as common sense

854
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,240
simply by lots of people

855
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,800
saying it again and again

856
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,520
and again and again and again.

857
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,160
Now, I'm not a political party.

858
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,360
We don't have a political party.

859
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,960
We will and are trying to influence

860
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,280
the political parties.

861
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,560
What I have is this YouTube channel, and you.

862
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,560
And we need to start using this message discipline now.

863
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,920
I need to keep saying, and you need to keep saying,

864
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,040
and you need to get your friends

865
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,920
and your family to keep saying,

866
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,640
obviously, the reason why you guys are getting poor

867
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,600
is because of growing wealth inequality.

868
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,120
And you can choose when you push that message,

869
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,280
either to use my name and my videos or not.

870
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,040
So you can go to your friends and family and say,

871
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,120
hey, look, there's this guy, Garys Economics,

872
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,800
I think he's explained it really, really well.

873
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,560
I think if you watch his videos, it's really compelling

874
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,600
that actually the reason for growing poverty

875
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
is inequality.

876
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
I think it's important that you, to stress this,

877
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,920
you increasingly say it's obviously true

878
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
because it is obviously true.

879
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,080
Obviously, you cannot squeeze

880
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,640
all of the wealth out of the middle class

881
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,920
and not expect poverty.

882
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,200
You cannot concentrate the wealth

883
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,960
into an unbelievably small group of people

884
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,360
and not expect poverty.

885
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,560
These things are obviously true,

886
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,320
and we need to make it understood

887
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,040
that they're obviously true by saying them again

888
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,520
and again and again and again.

889
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,200
And when I say you can use this channel or not

890
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
use this channel,

891
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,680
what I mean is,

892
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,080
if you think it's the best way to convince someone

893
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,520
to send that podcast

894
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,320
or to send them to our Understanding

895
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,120
the Economy series, do that.

896
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,400
But I think one weakness that we have,

897
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,440
one weakness that I have

898
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,040
is that this channel is called Garys Economics.

899
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,960
The logo is like my face

900
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,440
and it's become very attached to my personal brand.

901
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,320
It's very, very important

902
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,000
that these ideas are not 100% attached to

903
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,520
‘these are Gary Stephenson's ideas’,

904
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:23,320
because it's easy to take out one guy, basically,

905
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,520
I know how this is going to work.

906
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,880
If this keeps growing at the way...

907
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,560
at the rate that it’s growing,

908
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,880
I will get attacked more and more

909
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,880
and more and more and more by the press, by the media.

910
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,280
And eventually these guys will land the punch

911
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
that's going to land, and I will probably be gone,

912
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,080
and I understand that's how it works.

913
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,040
It's important

914
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,800
that rather than just saying

915
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,120
“Go watch Garys Economics”,

916
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,400
that you start understanding these ideas yourself

917
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,240
and talking about them

918
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,080
as your ideas, as ideas that are obviously true,

919
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,160
that you understand

920
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,120
it's really, really important

921
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,880
that we have a diversity of voices saying this

922
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,920
and that it's not just me, it's not just me.

923
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,920
And that brings me to another weakness that we have,

924
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,600
which is,

925
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,160
we need broader buy in from powerful spaces.

926
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,840
So what I mean when I say that is, I decided

927
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,000
very consciously to move to a YouTube channel

928
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,200
as opposed to writing for The Guardian, for example,

929
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,200
because I felt that

930
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,800
it would be meaningful to working class people

931
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,280
to see and hear somebody

932
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,680
from a working class background

933
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,560
speaking about the economy.

934
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,360
And I think that is one of the reasons

935
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,520
why this channel has been popular.

936
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,280
I think that's one of the reasons

937
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,480
why the book is popular,

938
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,880
because working class people

939
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,480
really want to see somebody from the same place

940
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,720
as them, speaking about the economy.

941
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,000
That makes me a powerful communicator

942
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,320
to ordinary people, to the working class.

943
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,960
But it really, really

944
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,800
hurts me

945
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
when I'm trying to communicate

946
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,320
to people in positions of power.

947
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,280
So when I say that,

948
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,800
I mean high level politicians

949
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,280
or really any politicians, people

950
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,440
in the media, high level economists,

951
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,880
central bankers, people in think tanks,

952
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,760
people in the civil service,

953
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
you know, there's this,

954
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,680
it’s a relatively small group of people

955
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,400
who control the levers of power.

956
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,520
And almost all of them

957
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,680
are rich, posh people

958
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,000
that come from rich, posh schools.

959
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,160
And they don't like me.

960
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,560
They don't like the way that I look.

961
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,040
They don't like the way that I sound.

962
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,360
They don't like the way that I come out of nowhere

963
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,000
having made a ton of money and say,

964
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,880
you guys are all idiots, you guys are all wrong.

965
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,200
And that's very understandable.

966
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,440
That's very, very understandable.

967
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,360
So we need and what I need you to do if you can,

968
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,560
is to act as a go between.

969
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,760
Basically, you act on two levels.

970
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,480
Which is number one,

971
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,640
you really make this common sense wisdom

972
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,720
on the streets amongst ordinary

973
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,680
British men and women or American men and women,

974
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,600
if that's where you are.

975
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,360
Get everybody to understand it.

976
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,840
But if you are able to get into positions of power

977
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,600
or influence people in positions of power,

978
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,480
politicians, media, influencers,

979
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,000
celebrities, you know, love to get Carol Vorderman

980
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,360
on the channel if you're interested.

981
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,120
Civil service, academics,

982
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,760
if you can get into these spaces

983
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
or influence these spaces,

984
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,280
especially if you sound less working class than me,

985
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,760
I need people like you to act as go betweens

986
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,920
and don't go in there and say, “Oh, Garys

987
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,920
Economics is really smart and you guys are idiots.”

988
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,560
Go in there and speak in your posh voice and say,

989
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,960
hey, I think this idea is,

990
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,400
I think this idea,

991
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,640
this poverty could be caused by inequality.

992
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,160
We need academics saying it.

993
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,680
We need people on the political left saying it.

994
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,360
We need people like these think tanks saying it.

995
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,320
We really, really, really need more diversity of voice.

996
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,640
We are all part of this conversation.

997
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,800
So I need you to boost the ideas, boost

998
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,600
the videos, boost the channels,

999
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,400
but also start trying

1000
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,080
to spread them, trying to understand myself.

1001
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,800
I want to see

1002
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,520
academics at Oxford or at Harvard

1003
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,000
or at Cambridge or LSE writing papers saying

1004
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,040
we think the reason for growing inequality,

1005
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,920
before growing poverty is growing inequality.

1006
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,880
I need other people saying it, other people

1007
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,080
saying it, with voices like that, it can't just be me.

1008
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,680
And if we do that,

1009
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,760
I think we can win.

1010
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,040
I think we can win.

1011
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,600
You know,

1012
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
I've been doing this for a long time,

1013
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,400
and I never expected it to kind of grow

1014
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,640
at this unbelievable pace that it is growing.

1015
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,000
And it's

1016
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,680
quite scary for me, to be honest,

1017
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,120
to see the, like, the growth on the channel and

1018
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
the book's been number one

1019
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,000
for six weeks now and I just...

1020
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,480
yeah, I get recognised all the time.

1021
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,960
It's scary and it's weird.

1022
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,480
But basically I was always convinced that

1023
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,440
a simple true message,

1024
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,080
which could continually be reproving

1025
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,720
by predicting better than the mainstream media,

1026
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,280
predicting better than the mainstream politicians

1027
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,760
would be believed by the public, and

1028
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,000
I think it's starting to be proven to be true.

1029
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,400
So my message to you guys is

1030
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,880
get on board, start singing from the same hymn sheet.

1031
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,400
Get some message discipline.

1032
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,880
If you're out there in the political left,

1033
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
ask your political party you’re

1034
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,160
associated with or your think tank you're in,

1035
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,000
or the groups you're associated in,

1036
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,600
why are we not talking about inequality

1037
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,480
as the cause for poverty?

1038
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,320
Why are we not saying that?

1039
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,600
If you're on the political right,

1040
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,880
if you’re a member of the Conservative Party,

1041
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,120
if you're a Reform voter,

1042
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,160
ask them, why are they not saying that?

1043
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,600
You know, this is not a left or right issue.

1044
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,840
This is a poverty issue.

1045
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,120
This is going to happen in every country.

1046
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,480
And it doesn't matter who's in charge.

1047
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,320
Both Donald Trump and Labour

1048
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,400
are presiding over increasing inequality.

1049
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,440
You know, call in to LBC, ask them,

1050
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,600
you know why you're not talking about inequality.

1051
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,160
Inequality is blowing up.

1052
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,560
Stock markets are all time highs.

1053
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,400
The rich are richer than they've ever been.

1054
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
And yet ordinary families can't turn the heating on.

1055
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,200
You know, make it common sense.

1056
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,720
Of course it's inequality. Of course it's inequality.

1057
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
Say it again and again.

1058
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,040
Share it.

1059
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,400
Share it with your friends. Share it with your family.

1060
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,680
Share it with anyone who has any position of power.

1061
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,960
You know, call into the call in shows.

1062
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,320
Make this the new common sense.

1063
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,160
And I guess this brings me to the final point,

1064
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,560
which is a lot of people

1065
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,480
want concrete actions.

1066
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,360
They say to me, “What can I do, Gary? What can I do?

1067
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,920
You freaked me out. You scared me.

1068
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,720
What can I do?”

1069
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,800
And I want to finish this video by trying my best

1070
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,000
to give, like a really clear

1071
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,720
answer to that question of what can you do?

1072
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,080
The first thing I want you to do,

1073
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,120
is take a big breath in, and a big breath out

1074
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,920
and recognise

1075
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,760
this economic situation, is an economic situation

1076
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,480
that is going to get worse.

1077
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,360
It is an economic situation that is going to get worse.

1078
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,600
This situation of

1079
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,880
dislike of immigrants,

1080
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,680
dislike of foreigners is also a situation

1081
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,000
that is going to get worse.

1082
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,400
Both of those things

1083
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,560
are going to affect different people differently.

1084
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,960
You know, if you are not the poorest, think about

1085
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,120
how that's going to affect people poorer than you.

1086
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,440
If you are not on the sharp

1087
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,280
end of the anti-immigrant, anti-foreigner hatred,

1088
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,760
think about how it's going to affect people who are.

1089
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,520
The reason I say those things is twofold.

1090
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,400
The first one is,

1091
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,400
I need you to be ready emotionally for the difficult

1092
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,160
and divisive times that are coming,

1093
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,800
because if you are angry,

1094
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,920
if you are frightened, if you are scared,

1095
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,440
I can't do nothing with you.

1096
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,000
I can't do nothing with you.

1097
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,680
I want to tell another quick story

1098
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,840
from when I went on Piers Morgan a few weeks ago.

1099
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,240
So when I went on, piers was running like quite late.

1100
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,560
Like an hour, maybe like an hour, 20 minutes late,

1101
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,840
which meant I had to sit in the green room

1102
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,000
with Dave Rubin and his entourage for

1103
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,800
an hour and 20 minutes.

1104
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,200
They're very nice.

1105
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,040
And while we were in the green room, we could,

1106
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,000
we could see on a big TV the interviews

1107
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
that Piers Morgan was doing.

1108
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,600
And,

1109
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,720
I don't watch Piers Morgan's channel normally,

1110
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,840
but I watched these

1111
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,920
about an hour of interviews,

1112
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,960
I think it was two interviews before I went on, and

1113
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,600
I could see what they were doing, right.

1114
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,160
They have their left wing head

1115
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,360
and they have their right wing head.

1116
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,520
And both the interviews before mine,

1117
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,160
they had

1118
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,560
the left wing heads were all black

1119
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,480
and the right wing heads were all white.

1120
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,520
And they tried to say things to make that left

1121
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,080
wing head angry,

1122
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,920
to make them, to make them lose their temper.

1123
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,000
When I was on, they wanted to get...

1124
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,840
I think there was a, there was a transsexual who,

1125
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,200
they were trying to get her angry about

1126
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,160
the Olympics or something.

1127
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
Just trying to get her to say something outrageous.

1128
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,760
Tried to get her to lose her temper.

1129
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,640
Then they looked at the audience...

1130
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,720
They looked at the audience and say, look,

1131
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,920
this is what those people are like.

1132
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,960
And what they're trying to do is, is cause division.

1133
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,360
They're trying to cause division.

1134
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,920
They're trying to make you hate each other.

1135
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,240
They're trying to make you angry.

1136
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,800
They're trying to make you think those guys out

1137
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,840
there are your enemy.

1138
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,200
And when I say that,

1139
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,760
I'm not just talking to the political right,

1140
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,920
I'm talking to the political left as well.

1141
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,120
They want you to hate each other.

1142
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,840
They want you to be angry.

1143
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,800
Listen, here in the UK, in the US, all over the world,

1144
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
the working class is multiracial,

1145
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,440
it's multi-ethnic, it includes

1146
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,400
men and women

1147
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,640
includes people who own house, 

1148
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,520
people who don't own houses.

1149
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,600
If you hate each other,

1150
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,560
if the men hate the women and the women hate the men,

1151
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,280
and the white people hate the nonwhite people in the

1152
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,000
not white people hate the white people,

1153
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,400
I can't do nothing with you.

1154
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,000
We will never be able to stand together.

1155
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,280
We will never be able to fight.

1156
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,880
We'll never be able to win.

1157
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,040
The power that we have is that there's more of us.

1158
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,520
That is a power we only use if we fight together.

1159
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,240
We cannot afford to allow ourselves to be frightened,

1160
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,600
to be scared, or to hate each other.

1161
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,840
The second thing is, I need you guys

1162
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,520
to be prepared for a long fight.

1163
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,800
We don't win this tomorrow,

1164
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,040
we don't win it the next day,

1165
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,120
we don't win this next week,

1166
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,000
we don't win this next year. Okay?

1167
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,040
Your grandparents, your great-grandparents,

1168
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,360
your great-great-grandparents

1169
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,000
fought for generations

1170
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,680
for the kind of ability

1171
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,000
you have to own assets

1172
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,880
and that your parents had to own assets.

1173
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,360
This is not a fight we win quickly.

1174
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,960
The reason that I say that is that I know

1175
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,800
people want me to arrange

1176
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,200
some kind of march on Parliament.

1177
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,720
We talk about this a lot.

1178
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,280
I don't want to get you guys to go

1179
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,360
crazy, email

1180
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,440
your MP every day, march on Parliament,

1181
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,720
use all your energy,

1182
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,960
and then be a situation

1183
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,560
where we're not in a position to get anything.

1184
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,440
I don't want you guys to be disappointed.

1185
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,040
This is a long fight.

1186
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,760
You need to conserve your energy for a marathon,

1187
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,280
not a sprint. Okay?

1188
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,120
We build,

1189
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,280
we build, we build, we build, we build, we build,

1190
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,520
and then we go together and we win.

1191
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,760
When we have enough power, we can win the argument.

1192
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,520
We are fighting against two political ideologies,

1193
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,960
which will definitely drive your family

1194
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,480
and your kids families into poverty.

1195
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,040
They've got nothing to offer you.

1196
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,560
The argument is there, the argument is simple.

1197
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,880
We need to get wealth back

1198
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,600
into the hands of ordinary families.

1199
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,120
That means taxing working people

1200
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,760
less and rich people more.

1201
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,480
Tax wealth, not work, protect ordinary families,

1202
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,040
make it common sense.

1203
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,000
Tell your friends.

1204
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,360
Tell your families. Build the movement.

1205
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,440
Support other people who are saying the same things.

1206
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,960
Be that person yourself.

1207
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,920
We need more voices singing off the same hymn sheet.

1208
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,360
We can win this argument.

1209
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,400
Win the argument, you get the power,

1210
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,640
you change the tax system

1211
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,320
and then you get your assets back. And that

1212
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,960
is how we stop the economy from collapsing.

1213
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,080
Good luck. Thank you.

1214
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,720
Send it to your mum. Send your friends, to your family.

1215
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,640
Good luck.
