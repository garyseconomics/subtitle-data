00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,560
Today we have got a guest on the channel.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm introducing Jimmy the Giant.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,680
Is that what we’re calling you? Yes.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,200
So Jimmy the Giant has a YouTube channel

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,080
where he talks politics, economics, subcultures.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,400
He's got a video on there

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,000
called How I Escaped the Alt-Right Pipeline,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,480
which talks about how

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,000
he was a big fan of Jordan Peterson. Yeah.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,560
And how he's been watching a lot of stuff.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,720
He's been watching our channel,

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,840
and it's made him more skeptical about

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,920
these rightwing ideas, it’s

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,240
made him more interested in inequality, economics.

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,400
A lot of people have been messaging saying

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
we should chat.

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,360
I’ve been wanting to get more people on, basically

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,960
to talk about what we're doing.

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,800
More YouTubers, people

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
who are talking about the same thing.

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
So, welcome to the channel, Jimmy. Hello. Hello.

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,480
Really, the main thing I wanted to talk about,

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,080
the main reason I wanted to have you on is because.

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,360
So,

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,760
as you know,

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
I've been doing this thing for a while, right where

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm trying to create a space where

29
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,440
people who are worried about the economy can come.

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,040
They feel like welcomed.

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,360
They feel like they can understand what's happening.

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,320
They feel like empowered,

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,840
and they can just develop this understanding

34
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,200
in a way that's like, not,

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,560
like a non-hostile space.

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,920
Because the way I see it is

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,480
bringing people to the YouTube...

38
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,720
look, at the end of the day, what I'm doing,

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,800
I'll be straight with it, it’s a political project.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,160
Yeah, yeah. It's a political project.

41
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
And

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,880
this might sound,

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,040
I honestly think there is nothing

44
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,320
more powerful politicising

45
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,040
than giving people

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,720
a good understanding of what's happening. Yeah.

47
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,240
Because the reality of what's happening here

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
is just going to get worse.

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,480
And I think this so,

50
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
I just shot a Musk video before this

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,160
and I know you're going to shoot one.

52
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,880
He's the gift that keeps giving for content.

53
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,480
He's going to be funding a lot of this

54
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,400
like anti-immigrant rhetoric right. Yeah.

55
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Obviously we are never going to be able to compete

56
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,560
for funding with people like Elon Musk.

57
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,360
Where we can compete is,

58
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,800
the reality of the situation is

59
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,920
if we keep going in this direction,

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,240
poverty will get worse and more

61
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,000
and more people will be in poverty.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,880
And they can never say that.

63
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
Yeah.

64
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,640
Well, I mean, they will say that, and they’ll say it’s

65
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,720
because of immigration.

66
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,040
This is one I've been kind of confused about is like,

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,120
this is about immigration,

68
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,960
but it ties obviously into economics.

69
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,840
Why would right-wingers who are in big businesses

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,880
like an Elon Musk,

71
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,160
I think I understand for Elon,

72
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,240
but there's other examples.

73
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,800
Why would they be anti-immigration?

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,120
Because for them, obviously immigration

75
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,680
is better for their business largely.

76
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
So by the time this comes out

77
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,480
my Musk video be out and it's described in there.

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,840
But I'll go through it.

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,720
I mean to be honest,

80
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,400
this the way I see it, the way I see it,

81
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,240
it makes total sense, right. Because

82
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,800
in my opinion, economy is going to keep getting worse

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
in terms of living standards.

84
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,360
And it's already been getting worse for a long time.

85
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,320
And people are super,

86
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,680
super unhappy with the status quo,

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,960
with the way things are.

88
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,080
So if things keep getting worse,

89
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,120
people demand some sort of change on the economy.

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,560
They're like,

91
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,840
we know that this direction is not working.

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,960
We need something else.

93
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,680
There's this quote from Milton Friedman,

94
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,920
which is like at times of crisis,

95
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,040
the alternative will be chosen

96
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,720
from the ideas lying around at the time.

97
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,920
So we are in a state in society now,

98
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,000
I think anybody really smart recognises

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,640
we're going downhill. Yeah.

100
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,240
And as you keep going downhill

101
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,720
eventually politically in democracies,

102
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,960
some kind of change has to be sold to the public.

103
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
So then we're looking around and we’re like,

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,320
okay, what are the alternatives?

105
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,120
It's really, really obvious

106
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,800
what the number one loudest,

107
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
most popular alternative is right now.

108
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,240
Like is these anti-immigrant,

109
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,800
anti-foreigner political parties

110
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
massively growing in popularity all over the world.

111
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
They are the loudest voice.

112
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,680
What's the second loudest voice?

113
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,440
I honestly think the second largest voice is us.

114
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Not just me, but like, you know,

115
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,400
you look at this,

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,320
Luigi Manzoni, you know, the support for him.

117
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,120
The alternative is Yeah, tax the rich.

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,080
And the right uses all...

119
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,920
That's always what populist right does.

120
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,240
It takes elements of populist left rhetoric.

121
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,040
So they will be anti corporations.

122
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
Like you see this weird

123
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,480
crossover where very rightwing

124
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,320
people will be anti corporations

125
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,760
or anti certain billionaires.

126
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,600
Because for them it's always about making a scapegoat.

127
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,360
And you can do that within even the billionaire class.

128
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,560
You can say like,

129
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,480
you can say billionaires are great like these people.

130
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,560
They fund our economy, they make jobs.

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,640
But it's those billionaires

132
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
and they always tend to end up

133
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
being the ones they don't like,

134
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,560
which is always the Jewish ones.

135
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,200
So they'll point out to George Soros and, you know,

136
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,160
certain ones.

137
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,400
That's maybe a little less true,

138
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,160
because they also point out,

139
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,440
like Bill gates and stuff like that,

140
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,720
but they'll pick certain ones.

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,280
Maybe the ones that align to like,

142
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,760
it seems actually more it's

143
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,880
the ones that maybe have some left wing

144
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,840
values or something

145
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,480
they pick, say, the left wing billionaires,

146
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,760
the ones who are bringing the world down,

147
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,960
but they understand that.

148
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
Yeah, well, everyone's always looking for an enemy.

149
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,400
In a time of crisis,

150
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,720
you're looking for an enemy,

151
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
and they understand

152
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,400
that, the billionaires understand that

153
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,640
and they are looking for, well,

154
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
how do we make it not us?

155
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,160
How do we keep some form of the status quo

156
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
but it's not us gets targeted?

157
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,560
So we pick these billionaires and these migrants.

158
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,520
Yeah, I think

159
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
these guys have lots and lots

160
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,040
and lots and lots of money.

161
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,880
And I think they understand

162
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
on like a pretty simple level,

163
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,120
we need

164
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,720
to fund

165
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,000
really

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
any potentially popular narrative Yeah.

167
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,880
that is not blaming us. Yeah.

168
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,200
Ultimately not a lot of people put money into

169
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
like funding this narrative building. Yeah.

170
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
So the billionaires don't need to pay that much

171
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,640
to kind of dominate the narrative the narrative. Right.

172
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600
Because also it's like,

173
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
this is the thing I came

174
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,720
to the enlightenment of, and it's crazy

175
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,280
it took me some f**king long,

176
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,160
but it was like

177
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,120
there is the separation of left

178
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,080
wing economics, the left wing social values.

179
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,680
So the way that a right-winger

180
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,200
can look at the world and say it's overrun by leftist

181
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,040
is because they're talking about social values

182
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
and they're talking about like LGBT representation,

183
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,480
discussions on race, discussions on gender.

184
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
They consider that the left.

185
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,440
Whereas you could,

186
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,880
I mean, you can literally not believe

187
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,600
in any of those things.

188
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
You could be a racist lefty on economics,

189
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,720
but right wing on social values,

190
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,240
so they can paint the world

191
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
as being overrun by leftists

192
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,200
where we're so right wing on economics.

193
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
And because people don't have this education

194
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,240
of understanding this terminology,

195
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
it gets so confusing.

196
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,240
Because they can say, oh look at the left and their,

197
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,160
you know, LGBT flags

198
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,640
on Oxford Street and blah, blah, blah,

199
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,720
we’re controlled by the left.

200
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,040
And you’re like,

201
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,720
but bruv, we have like f**king

202
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
foreign billionaires own our water,

203
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
they own our f**king railway.

204
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
It's like,

205
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,080
it'd be insane to think that we're left

206
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,160
on economics in this country.

207
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,960
I mean, we have obviously some safety nets.

208
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,680
Yeah But that's

209
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,040
how they perceive the world from this lens.

210
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
And it's like,

211
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,480
that's a level of education

212
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
people need to start understanding.

213
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,360
That separation of left wing social values

214
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,720
and left wing economic values.

215
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
And that's the thing I try...

216
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,320
I talk a lot on economics. Yeah.

217
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,520
Because I personally believe like a lot of social

218
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
things are downstream of economics. So I think you,

219
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
in societies where it's more equal,

220
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
you probably find there's less discrimination.

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
So I sort of believe in that rising tide floats

222
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,280
all boats in this premise where it's like,

223
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,560
if we can reduce inequality,

224
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
if we can raise people's living standards,

225
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,800
you'll probably find less racists,

226
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,360
and you'll probably find that people get along,

227
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
maybe, not 100%.

228
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,600
You still need to put efforts into those things,

229
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,040
but I think you have, this is like putting your...

230
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,080
I think when you over focus on like the social issues,

231
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,360
you're putting your cart

232
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
before your horse for the cart,

233
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
whatever the f**king expression.

234
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
Yeah. I mean, you know, you know, I do like.

235
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,120
I just, I barely speak about social issues.

236
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,280
I mean, the only reason I've,

237
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,040
I've been talking a little bit

238
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,880
more about immigration recently,

239
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,920
and I'll tell you exactly why.

240
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm not an expert on social issues, right.

241
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
You know, and I'm not an expert on immigration.

242
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm an expert on economics.

243
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
The reason I’ve started thinking

244
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,960
about immigration is because

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,120
I started seeing it in the comments.

246
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
I started seeing in the comments.

247
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Yeah, yeah. It’s all I get..

248
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Obviously my channel’s called Gary’s Economics.

249
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,560
We talk about economics, right?

250
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,480
And

251
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,080
it was about a year ago,

252
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
maybe more, like a year and a half.

253
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I started to see,

254
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
people talking about immigration in the comments

255
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
and I was

256
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,160
quite confused initially because,

257
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
like, immigration

258
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,440
was not really previously seen as an economic issue

259
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,840
and it first started popping up here and there and,

260
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,760
then it started popping up more

261
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,360
and more and more and more and more.

262
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,200
And I started to see

263
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,960
some people are definitely being told the reason

264
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,640
you’re poor is because of immigration.

265
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,480
That's everyone's been told that by everything.

266
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,240
Yeah, I remember I was watching...

267
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,880
so I watch like BBC news,

268
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
Sky news every morning

269
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
when I'm eating my breakfast because I want to see

270
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,800
like what people are being told.

271
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,240
Still you watch, this is what you watch now?

272
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,120
Yeah still, still, still.

273
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't watch a lot of like alternative economic stuff

274
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,360
because what I want...

275
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,320
I want to know what the majority of people

276
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,760
are being told. What is the mainstream narrative.

277
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,280
That's probably from your...

278
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,680
That's probably what made you good at economics,

279
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,840
because when you were in the book,

280
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,920
you were talking about asking your mates

281
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,560
why they're struggling in the economy

282
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,960
rather than reading stuff

283
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,840
because you're trying to get

284
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,120
like you're trying to see the world

285
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,520
from the perspective of the people you want to help.

286
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,240
Yeah.

287
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,560
To be honest it probably related a little bit to

288
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,240
when I was a trader, because as a trader,

289
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,280
for me it was always these two things.

290
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,000
It was like, what's the reality? What's the reality?

291
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
What's going to happen?

292
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,320
But the time you make money as a trader

293
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,640
is when the reality is different from the popularly

294
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,960
perceived opinion.

295
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,640
Like if people are right about something,

296
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,400
then the prices are right and there's no money.

297
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,560
Like when there's money as a trader

298
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,280
is when there's a big gap between what's real

299
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,160
and what most people think.

300
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,200
So this is where the market is like

301
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,520
saying, this thing’s good, but you’re

302
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
seeing it, that in reality, this isn’t like this.

303
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
Yes, for me when I look at market,

304
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,480
you know,

305
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,560
I don't know if you've seen these trading floors,

306
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,000
they have all these screens with all these numbers.

307
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,920
Right.

308
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,960
It sounds like bulls**t.

309
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,440
But like when I see those numbers, it's like a forecast

310
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,840
for what's going to happen.

311
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
Like those numbers to me

312
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,840
are like a weather forecast like this,

313
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
you know, in six months time this will happen.

314
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,240
In three months time this happened, blah, blah, blah.

315
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,400
And I'm looking at that forecast and I'm saying,

316
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,600
is that really going to happen?

317
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
Is that really going to happen?

318
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,720
So like, you know, my big trade was after

319
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,680
2008 saying rates and stay low,

320
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,000
people thought rates would go high.

321
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,320
And that was basically because they thought

322
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,400
the economy would recover. Interesting.

323
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,680
How did you have the like

324
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,880
I know, sort of tangent,

325
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
but how did you have the confidence

326
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
because you were new in that job,

327
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,000
I suppose, at that point, you’d

328
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,480
only been there a couple of years?

329
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,920
Well,

330
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
I didn't really start betting on it until early 2011,

331
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,440
by which time I'd been full time for

332
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,680
just over two and a half years.

333
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,320
Because I'd be

334
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I'd be like, wow, I'm too new at this job.

335
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm probably like, wrong.

336
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,760
Maybe I have this intuition.

337
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,320
But probably I'm wrong.

338
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
But, you know, the thing is, like.

339
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,960
I went to LSE, you know, like, so I was like,

340
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,640
quite like a talented student in my primary school.

341
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,680
And then I went to grammar school, and

342
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,120
I was kind of like the smartest kid

343
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,000
in the grammar school.

344
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,240
You know, and then I went to LSE

345
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,040
and I thought LSE would be full of smart kids.

346
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
But the maddest thing about LSE in particular.

347
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,800
You know about LSE, right?

348
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,560
LSE, for those who don't know,

349
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
London School of Economics,

350
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,320
like a very fancy economics university London and, and,

351
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,080
loads and loads of foreign students.

352
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,240
I don't want to disrespectful to the foreign students

353
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
at LSE right.

354
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
A lot of these guys are not that smart.

355
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,360
Of course some of them are.

356
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,200
But at the end of the day,

357
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,680
the truth is

358
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,960
they're there because they're from very rich families.

359
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,520
Yeah.

360
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,720
And and the thing is, they don't even, often

361
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,280
they don't even need to be smart.

362
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah.

363
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,320
Because they're going to go home

364
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,680
and they're going to work like for like the government

365
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
or like for their dad's company or...

366
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,040
Some of the kids

367
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,120
dummest kids I've ever met were dumb as f**k.

368
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
And they're there.

369
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,120
The truth is, a lot of these guys

370
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,080
go to LSE to find a husband or a wife.

371
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,840
I know that sounds mad, But the thing is...

372
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,640
And they work for Goldman Sachs for a few years

373
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,720
and then they go, so they...

374
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,880
and then when I went into the trading,

375
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,240
when I went to trade, I remember being like one...

376
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,640
like one game theory class in third year LSE.

377
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,320
And the professor asked this question.

378
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
It was, I thought it was quite an easy question.

379
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,240
And he asked one guy.

380
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,200
Nothing. Another guy.

381
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Nothing. Another guy. Nothing. Another.

382
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,160
They don't, they don't f**king care.

383
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,880
They don't care.

384
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,200
And then they're going to go

385
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
and they're going to memorise

386
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,880
the last five years of exam papers,

387
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,240
and they're going to get like 71,

388
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,760
and it's going to be good enough for them,

389
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,440
you know what I mean? Like, and.

390
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,480
How do you make like...

391
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,040
this is one of the ones that drives me insane.

392
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,760
I used to believe it,

393
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
and it's funny how much I flipped, but

394
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,880
how do you make someone who's, like, on the right

395
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
understand that, like

396
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,320
meritocracy in that sense, like,

397
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,840
the smartest kid will not be the one that wins

398
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,280
like that?

399
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,160
Yeah, it is literally, I have met so many people,

400
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,920
and I think

401
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
if most people really are honest about life,

402
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,960
they will have noticed wealthy people who are dumb

403
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
and like they just had good backgrounds.

404
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,920
Like, I've seen that a lot.

405
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,520
I think

406
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,640
luckily from having went to,

407
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,800
I went to like public school

408
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,840
and then I went to a private school.

409
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
My parent’s got like inheritance.

410
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,920
So I went to like a private school.

411
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,480
All the kids were loaded.

412
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,280
And I saw quite a few of them are dumb

413
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,120
but obviously they’re kids.

414
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
But then when I got older, I worked in marketing.

415
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,960
And then you start like going to these f**king...

416
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,000
I'd be getting taken

417
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,040
to like these manor houses and stuff

418
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,360
where they would rent the whole place

419
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,040
out to have a marketing...

420
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,440
I don't know what we were doing.

421
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
We were just like,

422
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,240
I don't know what we were talking about,

423
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
but they would talk and discuss bulls**t

424
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,840
and you would meet some of the thickest people,

425
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
like really dumb people,

426
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,640
and they're in like senior positions

427
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
or at least doing well.

428
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,640
And it's like,

429
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,440
how do you break through to like, average

430
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
people who are maybe on the right

431
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,120
where they really believe this idea

432
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,320
that if you really work hard,

433
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,000
you will get ahead and you will win. Oh my.....

434
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,280
Do you want to ask your question again,

435
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,400
just in case we want to include one

436
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,880
where you don't spill a cup of coffee. Yeah.

437
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,080
So how do you get through to like people

438
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,320
that have really bought into this idea of meritocracy?

439
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,280
That is so clear.

440
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,600
Like, how do you get through to them

441
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,560
that just the smartest person doesn't win?

442
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,160
That isn't true.

443
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,240
I've met a lot of smart people who,

444
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
like Akala talked about.

445
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,080
It was like some of the smartest people I've ever met

446
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,840
were drug dealers,

447
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,600
or they went to jail and stuff like that,

448
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
and it's like it doesn't correlate.

449
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,720
It is literally your background plays

450
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,360
such a massive role.

451
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,560
I tell you what, I think

452
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,400
it's difficult

453
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,360
to get through to people like that when they're young.

454
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,880
Yeah.

455
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,480
And, you know, I look at my demographics on the channel

456
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,480
and we do really well at like 25-35, 35-45.

457
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,640
We don't do that well with 24 and under.

458
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,240
I’m the same.

459
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,960
And

460
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,760
I think the reason why is when you're 24 and under

461
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,440
and always like this when I was 24 under, you’re on it.

462
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
You're going for it.

463
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,880
You’re trying to make it,

464
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,200
you're trying to make your money

465
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,040
and like maybe to some degree

466
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,680
you believe if I go for it,

467
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
if I'm going to run for it, I'm going to make it right.

468
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,080
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,720
Very few people above 25 believe that.

470
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,040
Yeah, yeah, It’s so true.

471
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,760
Because the truth is, once you're older than 25,

472
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,560
if you have any visibility, like, of people

473
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,680
from different class backgrounds, you realise, f**k

474
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,120
me literally everyone

475
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,760
I know is exactly as rich as their dad. Yeah.

476
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,440
And you realise it like, you know, like.

477
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,560
I come from a poor background

478
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,920
and then I went to like LSE, I and went to Oxford.

479
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,560
Even the kids, you go to LSE

480
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,600
or, well,

481
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,520
even the kids go to LSE

482
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,440
that come from poor backgrounds.

483
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,160
They don't get good jobs.

484
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,000
The vast majority of them don't get good jobs.

485
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,840
And even the ones that were smart.

486
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,400
And you know like,

487
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,920
I was like, well I was one of the top students at LSE,

488
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
my grades were like one of the best,

489
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
some of the best grades in the whole university.

490
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,880
You've read my book.

491
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,960
I got my job by cheating in a fucking card game.

492
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,120
Yeah, yeah. Like that is the way. Like it’s...

493
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Like there are so few people,

494
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm literally trying to think of a single person I know

495
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200
other than me

496
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,720
that has significantly

497
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,760
like transitioned upwards, like in terms of,

498
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,080
like where they land. Yeah, yeah.

499
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,040
Like I used to think, you know, when I was,

500
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,760
I was like, definitely.

501
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:00,880
Yeah.

502
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,160
When you're younger, you're so right.

503
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,000
When you're younger,

504
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,760
you just don't want to be a f**king nihilistic person,

505
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,440
because you want to have some hope in life.

506
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,560
You want to think like,

507
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,280
if I work hard, I can get ahead.

508
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,040
But it's funny for me

509
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
how my attitude flipped from pre being like,

510
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,120
kind of like successful now

511
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,640
before I was super like,

512
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,720
anyone can make it, you just have to work hard.

513
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,400
I was looking around,

514
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,240
I was looking at all my friends

515
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,760
who were like doing well and the ones who weren’t.

516
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,480
And I was like, the ones who aren't doing well,

517
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,560
they're not working hard.

518
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,160
And so I made, you know, I was like, got some success.

519
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,120
And then my attitude completely changed

520
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,400
because I started to realise that

521
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,160
the reason I got success ultimately

522
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,120
really comes down to the fact

523
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,680
that my parents own their house.

524
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,240
I didn't have to move out of the house

525
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,560
until I was out 25, so my parents...

526
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,480
and I didn't go to uni.

527
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,520
My parents just allowed me to d**k around for like

528
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,240
eight years. I was just allowed to...

529
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,680
I told them, I'm going to make a clothing brand,

530
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,640
I'm going to make a vegan food stand.

531
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,000
And they, you know, they didn't charge me rent.

532
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,880
And so I'm already like all those factors

533
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,400
already not having to get out.

534
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,920
So I didn't have to get a full time job,

535
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,000
didn't have to pay rent.

536
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,680
So I have so much more time to take opportunities.

537
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
So meritocracy,

538
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,280
I do sort of believe

539
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,240
that meritocracy exists in the middle class.

540
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,440
If you're in a position where you have some comfort

541
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,960
and you haven't got to jump into some life commitment

542
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,400
at the age of 18 of some job,

543
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,160
because you need to make rent,

544
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,640
you can have like 6 or 7 years to figure s**t out,

545
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,000
take chances. And it's a game of probability.

546
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,360
Like the more chances you take, one of them will pop.

547
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,240
And for me, it worked out.

548
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,120
By the end of it, I'd gone and done a lot of hard work.

549
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,560
But the reason being I could do that

550
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,280
is because I had all that extra free time,

551
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,800
that most people didn't f**king have.

552
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,480
The reason my YouTube career popped off

553
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,080
was because I got furloughed

554
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,560
for two months as one of my videos went viral,

555
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,640
so I had two two months just to work on YouTube videos.

556
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
So I had the time.

557
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,800
I think, one thing I've been,

558
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
I've been wanting to talk about this

559
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,560
for a while, actually.

560
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
One thing about social mobility is,

561
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,840
social mobility exists at a very zoomed in scale.

562
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,880
So what I mean is if you take two people

563
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,520
from the same like financial background,

564
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,040
you know, two kids grow up next door to each other

565
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,400
on the same street.

566
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,000
If one of them, like, works really, really, really hard

567
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,760
and studies really, really hard.

568
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,840
And the other one, you know, sits around smoking weed.

569
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,200
Yeah.

570
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,280
Like most chances

571
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,600
this guy will end up richer than that guy. Yeah.

572
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,560
But if there's a kid, like ten minutes

573
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,400
down in the nice neighborhood.

574
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,280
He's from a much richer family.

575
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,880
That kid can sit around and smoke weed.

576
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,560
You’ll never catch him.

577
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
Yeah, yeah, You’ll never catch him.

578
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,480
What I mean is, like.

579
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,720
So it is true for people...

580
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,240
and what that means is then

581
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,800
social mobility seems real

582
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,320
because people compare themselves

583
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,440
to people on the same level.

584
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
I always remember... It's the same for me, man.

585
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,440
Yeah, my dad, my dad,

586
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,840
he won't like me calling him out on this,

587
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,280
but my dad is like he's a little bit Reformy,

588
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,440
you know what I mean like.

589
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,800
They all are.

590
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,520
There's a lot of people supporting Reform, right?

591
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,080
So we shouldn't take the...

592
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,240
we shouldn't mock it, right.

593
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
My dad is a bit like that. Yeah.

594
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
And he was like,

595
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,760
he was this kind of, you know, we just work hard.

596
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,320
We get our head down, you know,

597
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,920
we don't like point fingers.

598
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,880
We don't look at the rich and,

599
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,920
There's that Thatcher era,

600
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,760
that comes off the back that. He went... Yeah, yeah.

601
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,000
And he was like, he was like a big Thatcher fan.

602
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,040
And he probably was the generation that won off that.

603
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,840
Yeah, he was like 21/22 when Thatcher came in

604
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,480
and they thought it was like

605
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,800
cool and sexy, or whatever. But

606
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
he went

607
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,000
for a walk around the area he grew up with my mum.

608
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,240
They're from South London,

609
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,840
and they walked around Balham.

610
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,000
And they saw in an estate agent's window a street...

611
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,360
a house on the street My dad grew up, cost

612
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
more than £1 million.

613
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,520
And I think that's when he realised,

614
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,360
well it can't work.

615
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,760
Yeah. Like the...

616
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,440
How can social mobility exist

617
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,960
when the amount of money that I need to give my kids

618
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,080
the life that my dad gave me,

619
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,600
his dad was a bus conductor, right,

620
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,160
Is completely impossible

621
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
to get, no matter how hard I work.

622
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,280
Like that's the thing

623
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
that, this is the thing when

624
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,720
house prices become £1 million a house, £2 million

625
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,080
a house,

626
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,600
that means that social mobility

627
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,640
can only exist at a zoomed in level.

628
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,720
That means that, like,

629
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,040
no matter how hard you work,

630
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,920
even the amount of money I made Yeah.

631
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,360
I went to uni with kids from LSE, like,

632
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,560
it doesn't matter what I do,

633
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,720
I will never be as rich as them. Like, I will make,

634
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,360
you know,

635
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,440
very, very few people

636
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,280
will ever make the amount of money I made.

637
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,240
I will never even be able

638
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,720
to touch these guys, regardless of what they do.

639
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,160
Like, so, and that's

640
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,760
what it means when house prices are like that.

641
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,320
Yeah.

642
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,600
Well,

643
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,800
you were saying, and this is something

644
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,120
I've sort of thought about a lot

645
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,080
is like the separation of,

646
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,800
how would you word it, like

647
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,000
what can be true on an individual level,

648
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,320
doesn't necessarily ring true for a big group.

649
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,280
So like on an individual level,

650
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,760
and this what I say,

651
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,720
if I was to talk to a friend and be like,

652
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,280
and they would...

653
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
or like some young 18 year old lad

654
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,720
and he wanted life advice.

655
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,600
I would tell him all the libertarian,

656
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
go pull yourself up, go to the gym.

657
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,720
I would tell him all that s**t.

658
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,640
Yeah, but I would be insane

659
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,440
to think that

660
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,400
everyone in society

661
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,680
that that advice even works for everyone.

662
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,880
On an individual level,

663
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,760
you can probably improve your life

664
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,320
slightly like you’re example’s good.

665
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,080
If you had two guys from a working class background

666
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,320
one sitting around playing COD and smoking all day

667
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,080
and the other one's like working, he will get ahead.

668
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
He's probably never going to buy a house,

669
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,800
but he's probably going to get ahead

670
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,720
and the other guy's probably not.

671
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,320
So on an individual level,

672
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,360
while it is true, if you were to work harder,

673
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,560
probably you would improve your life fractionally.

674
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,120
It's the dumbest advice on a macro level.

675
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,680
Yeah. I want to be like really clear.

676
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,720
I ain’t telling nobody don't work hard.

677
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,600
And I never said...

678
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
That's where the left gets a bit lost.

679
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,480
I ain’t never said to anybody don't work hard.

680
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,160
And I'm not against making money like I've been poor,

681
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,600
you know and I ain’t going to tell...

682
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,320
you know.

683
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,680
Anybody out there, and I'll work f**king hard.

684
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,320
I worked hard, I worked hard to get my job

685
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,280
and I worked hard in my job,

686
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,360
and I worked hard to make money

687
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
and I'm supportive of all these things. But that...

688
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,200
and this is a big thing,

689
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,480
which I think about a lot nowadays is like,

690
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,680
I also understand that

691
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,480
class interests exist. Yeah.

692
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,800
And we live in a world where very rapidly

693
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,640
the middle class is losing to the super rich and

694
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,760
on an individual basis, these rich guys will win.

695
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,280
They will win.

696
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,320
Like you cannot compete

697
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,440
with these guys, they’re to rich, they’ll win.

698
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,800
And over time, that wealth will pass out of your class

699
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
and into their class.

700
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,160
And because you can't win on the battle of money,

701
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,840
you have to play the game of politics.

702
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
You just f**king have to.

703
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,800
You have to play the game of politics.

704
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,080
If you don't play that game, you’re going to lose.

705
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,080
But how do we communicate to people

706
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,760
that you basically, you have to do both.

707
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,520
In the sense that you have to work hard

708
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,920
and you have to save your money.

709
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
You have to try and invest,

710
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,120
you have to do all these things.

711
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,920
But if you don't play that political game

712
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,720
on the same team

713
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,560
as that guy that lives next door to you

714
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,680
as the same team as the guy in your football team,

715
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,560
as the same team

716
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,160
as, like the people you go to school with

717
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,720
is the same team as it, you know? That's why...

718
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,920
If you don't play that political game,

719
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,640
you basically you have to do both.

720
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,560
I think that is where the right does really well

721
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,440
with the young male demographic is because it offers

722
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
an empowering message, albeit stupid,

723
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,320
like to tell young people they can somehow, you know,

724
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,320
become a billionaire. It's like it's outrageous.

725
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,800
But to a young person who has no life experience

726
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,000
and no understanding of like complicated systems,

727
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,840
power structures and how they affect you,

728
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,800
that optimistic message will always sell to a good,

729
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,960
especially young men

730
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,240
who are being told they need to go and provide

731
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,080
need to become powerful and strong,

732
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,240
and we idolise that.

733
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,120
That's always going to win against this nihilistic

734
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,720
realism.

735
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
But this nihilism, this pessimistic, sad attitude

736
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
that I guess is what the left,

737
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,960
because we are more realistic

738
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,000
and we understand, like the average person

739
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,040
doesn't really have a f**king chance, that struggle.

740
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,880
So I think we need to find

741
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,000
like a really empowering message to give to people.

742
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,880
And I think what they...

743
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,440
I try and analyze, like what did they do

744
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,000
in like the 1920s and like

745
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
when you had the work,

746
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,960
like the labour movements, there

747
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,280
they were empowered, like they weren't p**sies.

748
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,800
They weren't going, man, this f**king sucks.

749
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,120
They were like,

750
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,760
no, we're going to take down the f**king...

751
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,560
I mean, they were like,

752
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
some of them were wild communists, but they were like,

753
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,520
we're going to take down the bourgeois,

754
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,160
blah, blah blah.

755
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,640
But they were,

756
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
they felt like they were having

757
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,800
a battle against the powerful.

758
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,080
And we can sell that message

759
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,040
like you can talk about how like, we will rise,

760
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,960
we will win and we will fight these people.

761
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,600
And that is more optimistic.

762
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,760
A young lad needs to get behind something.

763
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
A young lad doesn't want to sit there and be like,

764
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,560
man, this sucks. We're never gonna get anywhere.

765
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,880
We need to have like a battle and a fight.

766
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,600
And it might be dumb, it might be really stupid,

767
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,840
but I think that's how we have to

768
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,880
frame stuff is this is a big battle that we can win,

769
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,160
but we have to unite and fight against it.

770
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,000
And I think a lot of it is about rhetoric.

771
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,560
Like, I'm quite a believer in rhetoric.

772
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,760
Like, I think you need strong,

773
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,480
powerful ideas that motivate people.

774
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,400
I mean, that's why sort of your channel

775
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,880
caught my eye in a way. The big question I want to ask.

776
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,800
What do you think

777
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,120
we need to do?

778
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,680
What do you think we need to achieve, ultimately?

779
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,040
How do you think we need to play it,

780
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,480
to stop things from getting worse in the long run?

781
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,040
Because I think I struggle with

782
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
is I think we’re going to lose.

783
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,480
Yeah. I was talking to my misses about that.

784
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,560
I was saying, like, Gary is a pessimist.

785
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,520
Sorry, I don't mean...

786
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,800
You tell me what you think.

787
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,320
Well, I think that's like,

788
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,720
I think I would say I land on being more optimistic.

789
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,120
I perhaps that's always just how attitude has been.

790
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,800
And I was thinking,

791
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,680
you come across as a realist

792
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,720
and realists are pessimists because reality is

793
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,440
the fight is unbelievably challenging.

794
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,480
And if you're to be a realist, like

795
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
you can make the argument.

796
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,720
It's very unlikely.

797
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
But I think

798
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,160
that is important to have that realism because

799
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,560
it does keep you grounded.

800
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,160
But I want to make, I want to make clear.

801
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,120
Yeah. When I say, I think we're going to lose.

802
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
That doesn't mean

803
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,320
I think we're definitely going to lose.

804
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,200
I wouldn't do this job...

805
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,520
Listen, I'm a trader. I'm a betting man, right?

806
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,240
I wouldn't do this job if I thought,

807
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,400
if I thought we were definitely going to lose,

808
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,200
I'd just be off making my f**king millions.

809
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,360
I'd be in the Philippines somewhere

810
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
drinking piña colada, right,

811
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,200
I don't need to do this right.

812
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,760
I think that we have a chance.

813
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,520
I think that we have a chance.

814
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,800
I think that in a sense that because I'm

815
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
so pessimistic about the economy,

816
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,760
I think that actually creates

817
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,640
massive political opportunities.

818
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,560
I think that

819
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,800
the level of discontent on the street is massive.

820
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,520
I think that people don't f**king like Nigel Farage.

821
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,680
They just don't see anyone better. That's it, yeah.

822
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,040
I don't...

823
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,560
I think they honestly don't see anyone better.

824
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,200
Look, people hate the Tories.

825
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,000
Increasingly they hate Labour

826
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,760
and Nigel Farage is just like, I’m someone else. Yeah.

827
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,840
And I think that.

828
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,600
I think that there’s a f**king gap.

829
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,240
That's why I would say I'm optimistic.

830
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,480
I like to see a lot of stuff as like

831
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,400
a, like I play board games with my mates

832
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,920
quite a bit, like a lot of strategy games.

833
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,760
And, I wasn't...

834
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,520
I'm not even that good.

835
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,600
Always come second, but I like, my mate is very good.

836
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,480
I have a very smart, mate, and I always...

837
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,240
at the end of the game,

838
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,960
I always sort of like say, how did you do it?

839
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,560
And he's got such a strategic,

840
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,800
or he can think steps forward.

841
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,640
So I have picked up a bit of it

842
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,000
and I like looking at things like that.

843
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,480
So like I see right now, as a massive,

844
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,680
what you're saying, like, a massive opportunity.

845
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,160
Like there's two sides and it requires a lot,

846
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,560
lots of things to go right in order for it to work.

847
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,960
But I can see something like the fact that in Britain,

848
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
if we compare like, say,

849
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,080
everywhere is seeing this far right surge.

850
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
And that's obviously the fear of people who are like

851
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,400
quite economically left wing or whatever.

852
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,800
The far right surge is worrying.

853
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,840
But we see it in like European nations,

854
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,800
we see it in American...

855
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,720
in America, and we see it a little bit in Britain.

856
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,920
But I think Britain stands in a particularly different,

857
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,400
sort of set of material circumstances.

858
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,760
That make us a little bit less likely

859
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,640
to really fall down that rabbit hole.

860
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,920
And we have a bit more opportunity.

861
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,000
And I think a lot of it,

862
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
and it's like every bad thing

863
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,920
can be a good thing at some point.

864
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,920
So we had 14 f**king years of austerity.

865
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,360
And like I think when you look at Reform,

866
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,320
and I know they're a bit clever, like

867
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,120
sometimes they say

868
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,880
some sort of economically left wing thing

869
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,360
or we want to get free rail,

870
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,960
like nationalise the rail and stuff.

871
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,320
But fundamentally their economic beliefs are

872
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,040
small state, cuts,

873
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,760
and like you look at Rupert Lowe, he talks about,

874
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,200
we need to shrink the state

875
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,160
and they're sort of regurgitating that stuff.

876
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
I don't think that rhetoric will play

877
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,400
well with British people specifically,

878
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,600
because we've had 14 years of slashing the state.

879
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,480
We've cut half a trillion in planned

880
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,000
spending across those years, and we're all aware of it.

881
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,760
We can see the results of shrinking the state.

882
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,840
So that rhetoric

883
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,640
I know they're always going to lead with immigration

884
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,160
because I can get people in the door.

885
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,760
But if we really jump on, like talking

886
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,200
about their economic policies,

887
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,360
it's exactly the same as what we've had.

888
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,440
And you're basically...

889
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,480
Reform are just saying more cuts.

890
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,280
Like that is fundamentally where it will be.

891
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,080
So if we can jump on them on that stuff.

892
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,360
Then also the second thing is that, Donald Trump, he,

893
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
he's like so tied to Reform.

894
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,800
Like if you think the success

895
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,240
or lack of success of Donald Trump is also the lack

896
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,160
or the benefit Reform.

897
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
If Trump does really well,

898
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,360
Reform will probably do well.

899
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,200
But if Trump does really bad that's not good for Reform

900
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,320
because they're like in bed with them basically.

901
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,600
So Trump has four years

902
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,680
an our election,

903
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,480
if I'm not mistaken, is just after

904
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,960
when he will come out of office.

905
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,680
Yeah, it should be if it goes five years.

906
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,040
If he doesn't do another coup. Yeah.

907
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,840
So like we've got an opportunity

908
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,360
where we're going to see the Donald Trump era

909
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,920
and then we have our election.

910
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,240
So that is material...

911
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,120
that's like quite a different,

912
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,240
kettle of fish to other people.

913
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,200
Like for us that's really good.

914
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,560
We've had this 14 years of austerity.

915
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
We don't like big cuts.

916
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,120
Then we're going to see what Donald Trump does,

917
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,080
hopefully in our like from a gameplay mechanics

918
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,960
sort of perspective,

919
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,080
you want Donald Trump to kind of fail like it will

920
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,440
it will help us.

921
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,840
And so then after that, hopefully in those five years

922
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,680
we'll have enough time to push this message.

923
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,320
And the other thing is Reform are f**king

924
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
doing really well right now.

925
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,560
All the attention’s on them, right now.

926
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,480
Can they keep that momentum for five years.

927
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,320
And can we come up in that period of time.

928
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,520
That's my... I think...

929
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
not to again be the pessimist.

930
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,680
Go on. So I think,

931
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,200
I don't think Donald Trump

932
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,800
will stop American living standards from falling.

933
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,040
So I think you're right in that

934
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,600
because I think he's committed

935
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,360
to cutting tax on the rich.

936
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I don't think that's going to be good.

937
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,080
I think living standards

938
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,560
will keep falling in the States.

939
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,120
The problem we have

940
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,440
is that I also think Labour will fail.

941
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,520
Yeah, that's our problem.

942
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,200
So, and that's...

943
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,640
and it’s weird in a way because of course,

944
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,440
Labour are supposed to be a centre left party.

945
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,960
Trump and the Republicans supposed to be a centre

946
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,560
right party,

947
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
but they will both failed because of the same reason,

948
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
which is that they will not deal

949
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,080
with growing inequality.

950
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,000
And I think I haven't spoken about this yet, but like,

951
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,800
the next election will be interesting

952
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,360
because the right will be split

953
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,040
between the Conservative and Reform.

954
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,600
Labour, I think, will almost certainly do pretty badly.

955
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,920
So you could end up with this kind of weird

956
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,560
three way split.

957
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,480
Labour will probably also lose more to the Greens.

958
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,600
But that's to assume that Labour won't get taken over.

959
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,560
So this is, this is That's what we need to do.

960
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
And this is,

961
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,800
you know, what I wanted to ask you

962
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,720
then after this was like

963
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,360
after this sort of,

964
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,240
you know, what do you think our chances are?

965
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,880
I wanted to sort of zoom in a bit more on

966
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,440
you and me, because you and me are you and me.

967
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
And what we need to do is what is like

968
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,400
the best thing from our strategic position. Yeah, yeah.

969
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,680
Which is, what is the best thing for like us to do.

970
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,520
Because my plan... I think

971
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,520
there's going to be an opening.

972
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,080
I was going to say,

973
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,280
I think there's going to be an opening on Labour.

974
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,680
But to be honest, I kind of think, f**k Labour.

975
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,720
Not in that sense.

976
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,920
I don't want to be like, I hate Labour.

977
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,160
But what I mean is,

978
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,800
I think our only chance is to get the idea,

979
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,680
that inequality is the cause of living standards,

980
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,920
bang at the front of the conversation.

981
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,600
And it doesn't...

982
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,320
because you look at Rupert Murdoch, right?

983
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,480
He doesn't f**king lobby the Conservative Party.

984
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,760
He f**king tells the people what to think.

985
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,040
And then the Conservative Party

986
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,360
have to do what he says,

987
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,080
because if he controls what the people believe,

988
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,440
then that pushes it it doesn't matter. Yeah.

989
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,840
And you know, don't get me wrong.

990
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,560
You know, I would love to have Labour

991
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,880
coming to me and saying, you know, come.

992
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,720
But the truth is,

993
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,040
even if Labour were behind

994
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,760
me, if the public didn't believe

995
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,400
that you need to deal with inequality,

996
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,280
Labour couldn't do s**t anyway.

997
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,000
So I think that, okay, look at our YouTube

998
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,880
channels are whatever, medium sized or whatever.

999
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,960
But like we have a public voice

1000
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,200
and we can to some degree influence

1001
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,240
what the public think.

1002
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,120
And an engaged voice like our audience,

1003
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,280
I think they feel...

1004
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,160
and that's what I like reading in the comments.

1005
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,720
And I see it in yours as well. It doesn't sound like...

1006
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,360
people are kind of like on our side

1007
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,600
and they're like champion, championing us.

1008
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,280
And that's like a good sign for like some kind of,

1009
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,320
like movement or something

1010
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,040
is that you've got people

1011
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,000
that, you're giving them faith, like,

1012
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,440
you're giving them something,

1013
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,040
someone that can help fight for them.

1014
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,600
And that's like a good thing.

1015
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,760
I think what you're saying is right, personally, like,

1016
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,800
I would happily see

1017
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,160
just a pressure group, could be a party,

1018
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,120
like, only like Ukip were very good

1019
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,400
at pressuring the Tories, and I'm not opposed to that.

1020
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,280
My hope would be that you make a pressure group

1021
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,000
that forces Labour in a direction.

1022
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,600
And what you're saying,

1023
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,480
if you can force the public attitude.

1024
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,920
Yeah. Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1025
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,760
Like push the public.

1026
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,160
At the end of the day,

1027
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,920
if I'm right on this, and I think I am right.

1028
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,760
The public are f**ked

1029
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,520
if you don't deal with inequality. Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
And if the public know that,

1031
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,120
if they really know that,

1032
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,760
then it doesn't f**cking matter what Labour do

1033
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
and it doesn't matter what the Conservative do,

1034
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,800
it doesn't matter what Farage does,

1035
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,840
because

1036
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,960
the public can say,

1037
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,240
we are not going to vote for f**king

1038
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,760
anyone who doesn't deliver on this issue.

1039
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,120
And I think that that is, that is

1040
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,200
what I would hope to achieve.

1041
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,000
And when I say that, like

1042
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
this is one of the reasons why

1043
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,360
I kind of wanted to have you on, it’s not just me,

1044
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,880
and it's not just you, and it's not just me and you.

1045
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,120
This is a societal conversation.

1046
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,680
And if enough people get behind this idea and it's...

1047
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,280
obviously because we have YouTube channels,

1048
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,600
we can amplify our voices.

1049
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,520
But everyone has a f**king voice.

1050
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,000
So everyone, everyone goes out like, this is not just

1051
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,760
this is not something

1052
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
that will be decided on YouTube, right?

1053
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,040
Like people are going to watch this

1054
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,200
and then they're going to go,

1055
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,360
they're going to go to the pub with their mates, right?

1056
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,120
And they're going to talk about it

1057
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,880
to their mates, right.

1058
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,480
And they're going to go to f**king church,

1059
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,720
and they're going to go to f**king mosque,

1060
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,880
and they going to go to f**king football,

1061
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,280
and they're going to go to a f**king hair salon,

1062
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,480
you know what I mean, like. Ultimately,

1063
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,080
what I want people to do,

1064
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,960
what I want you to do, obviously you're your own man.

1065
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,680
What I want the people watching to do

1066
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,920
is the same thing I'm doing,

1067
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,800
which is f**king convince people.

1068
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,120
Yeah. That's such a good point.

1069
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,360
Yeah.

1070
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,920
Like, if you can just make if, like,

1071
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,240
if all job is to try and get the

1072
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,080
yappy political guy in your group

1073
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,360
to start seeing what we're seeing,

1074
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,080
if we can get him on board, he...

1075
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,760
and this could be anyone who's literally watching,

1076
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,120
you might not have a YouTube channel or something,

1077
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,760
but it could just be some bro

1078
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,160
who loves his politics

1079
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,400
and that,

1080
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,720
and he's the guy who will chat about that

1081
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,680
amongst his group,

1082
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,000
and he will softly influence his group.

1083
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
And then that can on a...

1084
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,920
if that happens on a large scale,

1085
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,320
that massively changes.

1086
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,480
The one thing I want to say on this

1087
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,440
when you mention that is just like,

1088
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,480
don't be pricks to your mates,

1089
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,080
because I know, like,

1090
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,720
you can p*ss people off if you're too aggressive.

1091
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
Like, and I know that I don't...

1092
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,240
I try not to talk, and I hope I haven't done it to you,

1093
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,880
I try not to talk disrespectfully about people

1094
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,840
who vote for Reform, and people who like

1095
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,200
people who like Donald Trump, people

1096
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,080
who like Nigel Farage, like, I don't, I don't...

1097
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,960
I think these guys are misdirecting you.

1098
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
We need to be like,

1099
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,680
you don't win arguments by telling people around you

1100
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,360
that they're fucking pricks. That's exactly right.

1101
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,480
Like 100%

1102
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,640
like we need to be bringing people in here, man.

1103
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
We need to be like, supportive, and like,

1104
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,920
people are scared, man. People are scared.

1105
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
People are hating immigrants, right?

1106
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
Because I watched Sky news the other day

1107
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,360
and it said there housing crisis, immigrants. God damn.

1108
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,240
As simple as that, right. And people are...

1109
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
people think,

1110
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,880
because people are being told

1111
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,600
that they can't get house because of the immigrants.

1112
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:52,920
Yeah.

1113
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,200
So like you can't turn around

1114
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,360
and be like anyone who wants

1115
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,520
low immigration is a racist.

1116
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,560
Anyone who wants low immigration is a prick, like.

1117
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,000
We need to convince them.

1118
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,840
Look, it's the growing inequality.

1119
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
We need to make that case. And it's not about like,

1120
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,160
p*ssing people off and pushing people away, like.

1121
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,200
Like people are scared, man.

1122
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400
Yeah, I agree,

1123
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,520
that's like one of those ones

1124
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,680
where you're saying like, well,

1125
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,640
I was thinking earlier, you know,

1126
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,920
I said about the meritocracy,

1127
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,600
there's a few certain, like, sticking points

1128
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
that I think people need more information

1129
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,240
on, simplified

1130
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
because at some point people

1131
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,160
didn't believe in meritocracy.

1132
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,240
At some point people didn't believe

1133
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,600
immigrants were the cause of all problems.

1134
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
But they heard a few little things,

1135
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,480
and they built up that story,

1136
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,320
that like belief in their head.

1137
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,160
And I think like the immigration one is one

1138
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,000
I try and attack at the moment.

1139
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,600
I've done a few videos, but it's like this zero sum...

1140
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,960
people have a massive gap of information

1141
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,080
with immigration.

1142
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,120
That was a bar.

1143
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,600
Information, gap of information about immigration,

1144
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,400
because we see it's such a zero sum

1145
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,000
way about when it comes to economics.

1146
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,200
And, this is like this thing that I realised as I got

1147
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,080
older is like, little information on a topic

1148
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,200
is worse than no information.

1149
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,800
It's like a classic thing people say.

1150
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,480
And like immigration is a really good one

1151
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,000
because you could say something like, you witness,

1152
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,200
I don't know, you worked in this industry.

1153
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,000
Say it was like,

1154
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,440
I don’t know, you worked at a shop,

1155
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,080
you're just stacking shelves or something,

1156
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,960
and you noticed that there's now,

1157
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,880
like an Asian guy doing that job.

1158
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,760
In your head from an individual level,

1159
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,600
if you don't understand macroeconomics,

1160
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,040
you have seen that guy took your job,

1161
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
and that's how you see it. But

1162
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,800
the understanding around immigration,

1163
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,120
how it affects economies is one of these areas,

1164
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,200
because we're so poorly informed about it,

1165
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,840
you’ll look at it from a surface level

1166
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,360
and not have a deeper understanding.

1167
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,160
It'd be like looking at the Earth

1168
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,640
in front of you and going, the world is flat.

1169
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
But we know it's not flat

1170
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,600
because when we were in school, we were taught about

1171
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,520
like how the f**king solar system works and all that.

1172
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,960
But because we see things

1173
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,560
and we have such a gap of information,

1174
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,240
you don't understand, like if an immigrant comes in

1175
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,960
and he takes your job, blah, blah, blah, whatever,

1176
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,840
you see that as a net negative to your life.

1177
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,000
But that immigrant who's come

1178
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,240
in, he's bought in, let's say

1179
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,440
he needs his haircut once every week,

1180
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,640
or he needs to go get his car repaired

1181
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
and he needs to go buy food.

1182
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,360
He goes to the local restaurant.

1183
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,800
That immigrant has bought trade

1184
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,160
to thousands of businesses.

1185
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,800
So like the way we understand economy,

1186
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,360
on like an individual level,

1187
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,000
when we see this

1188
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,800
guy's taking a job,

1189
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,960
we're not seeing the wider

1190
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,680
invisible effect that he is bringing

1191
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,200
benefits the economy.

1192
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,360
So like this is one of those things

1193
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,720
where if there's a lack of information,

1194
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,120
then people will just use their sort of like,

1195
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,280
firsthand

1196
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,040
interpretation of what immigration

1197
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,760
looks like in their life or whatever,

1198
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,000
and not expand it out to wider economics.

1199
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,320
Like that immigrant is a benefit

1200
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,560
because he's bought a load of trade,

1201
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,760
or he’s a new customer to this business.

1202
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,240
If you fit carpets or whatever

1203
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,880
he will one day need his carpet fit.

1204
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,640
He will employ you. Like do you see what I'm saying.

1205
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,080
And this is one of the topics like the meritocracy,

1206
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,720
where that lack of information,

1207
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,360
that lack of understanding

1208
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,440
allows people

1209
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,200
to just say like, yeah, they're taking your jobs,

1210
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,160
they're doing this.

1211
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,600
They're like,

1212
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,840
you know, stealing the houses

1213
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,440
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, man, I just

1214
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,120
I worry about

1215
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,560
the like corrosive effect it has on like,

1216
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,120
this community's basically like this.

1217
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,840
Because I know that,

1218
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,000
you know, people who want low immigration,

1219
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,040
they're not racists.

1220
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,840
Some of them there are some racists,

1221
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,200
but a lot of people are just told

1222
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,920
that this is the economic problem, right? Yeah, yeah.

1223
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,080
That's why they always say I'm not a racist, but,

1224
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,360
and that's why I've got an Asian mate.

1225
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,280
Because they're not fundamentally hatred,

1226
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,200
they don't have a hatred of their skin colour

1227
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
or their skin colour, whatever.

1228
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,400
They're being told

1229
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,600
that they're the root of the problem on a macro level.

1230
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah. I just see like it's f**king divisive.

1231
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,520
It is.

1232
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,640
It's f**king divisive. And,

1233
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,200
you know, I come from East London, you know,

1234
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,120
and it's like

1235
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,360
very, very, very multicultural place, right

1236
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
and that's not like unique

1237
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,680
by any stretch of the imagination.

1238
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,600
Like especially when we talk about poorer

1239
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,520
people in this country

1240
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,600
especially when we talk about the cities.

1241
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,080
Especially when we talk about younger people.

1242
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,040
It's a f**king multicultural country now, right.

1243
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,120
And I worry

1244
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,240
that all of this narrative,

1245
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,720
all of this like discussion about it,

1246
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,200
is driving people against each other

1247
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,040
and making people distrust each other.

1248
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,160
And for me, like the message

1249
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,480
I'm trying to push, the message

1250
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,760
I'm trying to sell is like

1251
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,760
that group over there, they're gonna take your stuff

1252
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,320
and on an individual basis

1253
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,640
they're much stronger than you,

1254
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,800
and the only way you can defend

1255
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,400
yourself is working together. Yeah.

1256
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,280
And

1257
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,560
if you know the working classes, which is, you know,

1258
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,480
the working class is racially diverse

1259
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,280
and the working class in this country

1260
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,040
is racially diverse. And,

1261
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,600
listen talking about the levels of migration

1262
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,120
you want is one thing, and like, I'm open to that.

1263
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,120
But like if this starts to spill into just like

1264
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,680
distrust between

1265
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,920
people of different races,

1266
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,200
we're f**ked.

1267
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,880
Are you saying like you think

1268
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,680
instead of trying to dispel

1269
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,600
every myth around immigration

1270
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,560
or every argument

1271
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,680
or whatever, even, you know,

1272
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,120
if they have some good arguments or whatever,

1273
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,360
instead of going down that route

1274
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,720
of trying to debunk and disprove and stuff,

1275
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,640
you would say it's better to

1276
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,920
just put the attention on the real like problem,

1277
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,040
which is obviously inequality.

1278
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,960
So like,

1279
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,600
are you saying from a strategical point of view,

1280
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,560
you don't know how valuable it is to like

1281
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,840
go into the ins and outs of why these people are wrong,

1282
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,560
but rather try and show why you're right.

1283
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,920
This is something I thought about quite a lot.

1284
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,720
There's a degree to which it's intentional

1285
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,080
that I haven't engaged that much

1286
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,160
with the debate on immigration,

1287
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,600
because I think it's f**king divisive. And,

1288
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,760
I grew up in a very multicultural area, you know, and,

1289
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,440
I went to...

1290
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,000
the schools I went to, literally,

1291
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,160
I went to schools that were like 5% white.

1292
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,800
Yeah, yeah.

1293
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,040
My school was at least 50%, 60% black,

1294
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,960
mainly Nigerians.

1295
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,360
So I was just completely normal with it.

1296
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,560
I was like, I didn't think about it.

1297
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,840
I just feel like if...

1298
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,040
I would like to find a way to...

1299
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,800
Obviously you’re affected in some way

1300
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,480
by being like a small ethnic minority

1301
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,840
in a place that you grew up but you,

1302
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,400
you form friendships.

1303
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,040
Of course, you form friendships

1304
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,640
with people from different ethnicities, right. And,

1305
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
we need to be able to see each other as f**king people,

1306
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,440
you know what I mean?

1307
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,000
And, like, not just the differences.

1308
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,640
So I always, always think that I'm always like,

1309
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,480
yeah, no matter how much you think you're different

1310
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,400
to, say, a guy who,

1311
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,680
even, like, say, someone who's come in as a refugee.

1312
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,240
How different,

1313
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,480
how different you might think

1314
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,280
your lives are realistically

1315
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,400
the things that happen on a political scale,

1316
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,960
those decisions

1317
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,720
the same decision

1318
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,440
if they raise a tax on,

1319
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,400
you know, working class people, or if they,

1320
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
I don't know, if they cut, more

1321
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,320
so, if they cut a certain public service,

1322
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,040
if they underfund the NHS,

1323
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,600
both you and the refugee

1324
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,920
are very negatively affected

1325
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,600
by that exact same decision,

1326
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,080
whereas the very wealthy person,

1327
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,200
they have private healthcare.

1328
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,200
So like your lives are affected by the same decisions

1329
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,360
in very similar ways.

1330
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,840
If house prices go up, that affects you.

1331
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,320
And the guy who goes to the mosque

1332
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,960
like your lives are both very negatively affected.

1333
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,960
The billionaire or the millionaire, even

1334
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,120
they make money off of that.

1335
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,440
So it's like you got to start seeing

1336
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,800
that the same things are affecting

1337
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,640
the people we think we have a lot of differences with.

1338
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,720
Our lives are so similar, I'm sure. Let's talk about

1339
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,080
how much do you think

1340
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,200
we could achieve on YouTube,

1341
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,760
and what do you think is the best way

1342
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,680
to be effective?

1343
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,720
Yeah, I think

1344
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,280
so my channels are projected like 2 to 3 years

1345
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,400
I’ll probably have like a million subs

1346
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,480
which is like big.

1347
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,120
That's really big.

1348
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,520
And I mean like videos, it

1349
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,120
depends, but it means on average

1350
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,000
they'll probably hit like half a million views

1351
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,600
and some like a million more often.

1352
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,520
And that's massive. And if my channel probably is...

1353
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,680
I think your trajectory is probably steeper.

1354
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,640
So yours would probably be

1355
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,600
in a similar category

1356
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,360
and bearing in mind

1357
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,000
that would put us three years out from the election,

1358
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,480
so we'd be in a bigger position at a time

1359
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,400
where we're still like, we're coming close to election.

1360
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,880
So that's like quite good.

1361
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
And I think if we can make this ecosystem

1362
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,240
like it's great

1363
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,200
that we're doing this because it's

1364
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,920
like if we can make an ecosystem

1365
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,040
of very similar creators and we talk to each other

1366
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,280
and we make cool, interesting, fun, engaging content

1367
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,600
that's relatable for just like average people. Yeah.

1368
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,560
I think,

1369
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,160
I don't know, I see it as a very powerful thing.

1370
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,480
Like, you got to think like Joe Rogan and all them lot,

1371
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,880
they all came from, like it was small in the beginning.

1372
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,560
Yeah. But it was well connected.

1373
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,040
And there were interesting people

1374
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,120
from different backgrounds

1375
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,040
and like, people love their culture.

1376
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,520
They loved the thing that it was like,

1377
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,360
you felt like you listened to Joe Rogan,

1378
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,600
you go to the gym,

1379
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,280
you're probably into

1380
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,240
maybe you got a little side hustle or something,

1381
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,160
and you felt like you're part of a thing.

1382
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,400
And I think if we can create

1383
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
something like that,

1384
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,880
especially like, you know, we

1385
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,600
we talk a lot about young lads,

1386
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,480
but I think, like on in my sort of channel and stuff,

1387
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,280
but I think like

1388
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,720
if we can give something for young lads

1389
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,760
I think would be great because if we can connect them

1390
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,560
then it will, yeah, it will just galvanize people.

1391
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,360
So I think we have a good timeline of doing this.

1392
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:04,920
This idea

1393
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,840
about like an ecosystem of different creators.

1394
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,880
One of the reasons I wanted to have you on

1395
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,200
is because I don't actually watch a lot of YouTube.

1396
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,040
I know you don't.

1397
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,480
I don't watch a lot of social media.

1398
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,680
Yeah, except for my ASMR, don’t

1399
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,320
out me for watching ASMR.

1400
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
So I don't watch a lot of social media.

1401
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,040
I know you all are a lot more clued in.

1402
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,840
So maybe you can talk a little bit about

1403
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,120
other creators that you think are doing good work.

1404
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,720
That people watching might want to go check out.

1405
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,800
And also about like,

1406
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,680
whether you are doing work yourself to try to sort of

1407
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,760
build a bit of community

1408
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,840
that is trying to do something

1409
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,920
a little bit more political.

1410
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1411
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,800
So I've started a discord

1412
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,320
like maybe a year ago,

1413
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,280
and that’s doing like pretty well.

1414
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,880
I think we’ve got like 2000 people and it's fairly new,

1415
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,840
but they're super active and they’re always chatting.

1416
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,040
So like,

1417
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,560
I've been,

1418
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,560
I understand

1419
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,600
the need to do the connecting the people and that,

1420
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,200
so I'm trying to get more into streaming

1421
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,160
because that's like the perfect

1422
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
platform for doing that.

1423
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,600
So I've been working on like,

1424
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,000
it's tough getting the time to stream,

1425
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,080
but the goal is anyway to stream

1426
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,280
a lot more and do collabs of different people.

1427
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,600
And like a list of creators, I would say,

1428
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,560
who are like killing it.

1429
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,000
That are sick, that I could see coming together

1430
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
as a people like Ordinary Things, he's sick.

1431
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,080
We don't agree on everything.

1432
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,080
But on the general problems

1433
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,240
about like inequality and stuff.

1434
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,800
We're like pretty clued in, on that.

1435
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,440
And he makes great videos. They're very funny.

1436
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,680
He's just a Britishy lad, like,

1437
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,720
you know, so Ordinary Things.

1438
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,800
And he's got a big audience. A million, whatever.

1439
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,880
Just Some Geezer.

1440
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,640
He's a younger, newer creator,

1441
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,880
but he's been making these, like, pieces

1442
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,880
on, like, right wing people.

1443
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,360
So he did one on, like, Tommy Robinson,

1444
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,520
and he did one on, like, Piers Morgan.

1445
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,480
And they're really good. He's quite funny as well.

1446
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,680
So I want to, like, connect that with him.

1447
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,120
Who else?

1448
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,200
There's a geezer by the name of Tom,

1449
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,720
is it Tom Nicholson? Tom Nicholson?

1450
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,160
Yeah, he's much, I’d say he's a smart bru.

1451
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,320
He's like a brains.

1452
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,960
He makes incredibly good videos and he’s

1453
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,920
yeah, he's funny and he's very switched on stuff.

1454
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,200
And his academic side is good

1455
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,440
because it makes you like,

1456
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,360
learn stuff that maybe you gloss over. Whatever.

1457
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,200
Who else?

1458
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,240
A Different Bias. He's a guy who makes daily...

1459
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,160
He's great, right.

1460
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,080
So we’ve got all these big video essay channels

1461
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,200
where we talk about very nebulous

1462
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,720
big topics,

1463
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,680
but, A Different Bias,

1464
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,640
he makes, like daily

1465
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,480
political commentary on British stuff.

1466
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,560
And he's very good.

1467
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,320
He's funny.

1468
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
They're off the cuff and they're like, good.

1469
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,200
So there’s people do this stuff.

1470
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,560
There’s people doing stuff, and they're funny.

1471
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,920
The charismatic people like, they think...

1472
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,880
I often think like, it's going to need that.

1473
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,160
It's going to need lots of different people

1474
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,360
doing lots of different things. And like.

1475
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,080
And I think streaming and podcasts,

1476
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,520
like connecting these people

1477
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,840
because that, that's like where everything's at.

1478
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,520
And I would like to say like, people watching,

1479
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,920
If you're interested in creating,

1480
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,760
like we need more people doing it,

1481
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,440
we need more people do.

1482
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,920
And people message me sometimes, you know,

1483
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,160
should I go into, should I study economics?

1484
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm quite anti it.

1485
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,720
But we need people studying economics.

1486
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,320
We need people buying into political parties.

1487
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,680
We need people going to the media.

1488
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,160
We need people doing like creative stuff.

1489
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,680
We need people creating art.

1490
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,640
Yes. Like musicians bruv.

1491
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,520
Yeah, whatever. Like wherever you are. Like

1492
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,160
if you're thinking about getting involved.

1493
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,880
Yeah. Get involved. And in your own way.

1494
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,080
What you’re saying is right about music,

1495
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,920
music is massive.

1496
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,200
Like I want to start making more music.

1497
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,720
You need to start making music.

1498
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,880
Get Gary on the mic.

1499
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,080
But yeah, like musicians and stuff.

1500
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,680
Because if you go back and listen to that

1501
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,200
old Akala, Fire in the Booth.

1502
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,240
You listen to it.

1503
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,480
The man just f**king explained inequality in a song.

1504
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,120
But I want to encourage people like, Akala is great,

1505
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,200
but you don't need to be Akala.

1506
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,720
No. What I'm saying is,

1507
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,360
we can all be influential in the sphere that we’re in.

1508
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,480
We can all be like

1509
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,960
you know, it might be like,

1510
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,480
you might just reach wherever your school

1511
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,640
we have people here who are still in school.

1512
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,520
You might just reach people in your workplace like.

1513
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,880
Make something like, do something.

1514
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
Reach people around you. That's what I would say.

1515
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,640
And I think, yeah, like,

1516
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,120
I know I keep banging on about that types of people.

1517
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,800
And I know it's sort of dumb and on a personal level

1518
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,720
don't really care.

1519
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,760
But like if you're someone, if you're like a geezers

1520
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,160
is f**king

1521
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,840
absolutely TRT’d out

1522
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,000
and you're massive

1523
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and who in our areas

1524
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,480
looks like that is making that content,

1525
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,960
and can speak to people that are similar like that.

1526
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,720
Same for like if you’re

1527
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,760
like a f**king lad from the ends,

1528
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,000
like if you started doing content

1529
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,960
or just doing something and talking about these topics

1530
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,120
you're going to speak to so many people

1531
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,960
that the really academic lot who are great,

1532
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,920
they're never going to reach

1533
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,800
and they're never going to appeal to you.

1534
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,680
Yeah that's what we...

1535
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,400
you need like,

1536
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,760
the more diversity of voices,

1537
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,760
the more diversity of voices.

1538
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
And it can work in weird ways, it can work.

1539
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,400
Like I remember when I was a kid,

1540
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,560
when grime popped off

1541
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,000
and it was like it was Dizzee Rascal and it was Kano

1542
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,840
and it was Wiley.

1543
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,280
And like for me, those guys were me.

1544
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,160
Like, I was like, these guys are me like,

1545
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,720
so you never really know, like.

1546
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,400
Yeah and it's like when, so like...

1547
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,520
I would like to add to a point like, you know,

1548
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,760
we need women doing this as well.

1549
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,560
Like, I know, like I see the dem’s,

1550
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,760
I see the demographics on my channel.

1551
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,840
I know it's mainly men watching,

1552
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,520
like everybody is welcome here.

1553
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,240
And we need people,

1554
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
we need people of all different demographics.

1555
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,440
And the ladies they’re a bit more ahead of us, man.

1556
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,720
They're more left wing,

1557
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,160
so they're doing a good job already.

1558
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,720
So like we're trying like but yeah,

1559
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,640
keep doing what you're doing.

1560
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,440
The ladies are smashing it.

1561
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,080
We need to pick up the the slack our end I think.

1562
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,200
But, yeah. I might need to try...

1563
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,440
Women are killing it. I’ll try to get people more...

1564
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,480
as many people on as we can.

1565
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,440
But anyway, I want to get to my next question.

1566
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,240
I know you've been following this channel for a bit.

1567
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,800
Is there anything that we've been talking about that

1568
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,320
you think it's not clear

1569
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,240
that you would like understanding better?

1570
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,400
Is there anything we haven't covered

1571
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,320
that you would like us to cover?

1572
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:37,560
Yeah.

1573
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,320
The one that does jump to my mind is

1574
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,160
if the wealthy own assets.

1575
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,360
I understand the housing.

1576
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,120
I can see, I can definitely understand

1577
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,800
the argument

1578
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,880
why housing, owning housing is very negative,

1579
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,800
net negative generally for people.

1580
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,400
If they own stocks in companies

1581
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,520
would the right wing argument not be correct,

1582
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,440
that that would bring more money

1583
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,080
to invest into the company to bring more jobs.

1584
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,320
And is that a fair argument?

1585
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,200
There being more wealth is not a bad thing.

1586
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,040
You know, if they’re creative,

1587
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,240
if wealth is being creative, that's a good thing.

1588
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,560
The problem is, is transfer. It's transfer.

1589
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,600
So like if those stocks used to be owned by

1590
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,800
ordinary people

1591
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,760
and then one generation down,

1592
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,360
then the other ordinary people don't have them.

1593
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,280
This is a problem.

1594
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,080
It's a problem because you need to that's

1595
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,720
that's what your pension is basically.

1596
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,480
You’re owning pensions.

1597
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,160
So like if these guys are owning the stocks

1598
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,800
and you're not owning the stocks,

1599
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
well then how are you going to pay for your retirement?

1600
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,760
You see what I'm saying. So

1601
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,840
So is there like statistics to say that like

1602
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,400
at some point

1603
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,680
working class or middle class

1604
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,520
families owned more stocks

1605
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,960
and now more stocks are landing

1606
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,200
in the hands of billionaires?

1607
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,840
Is that probably something to say there?

1608
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,760
Well, I mean, a lot of young people are just

1609
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,080
are not I’ve never even thought about it.

1610
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,040
Like pensions, you know,

1611
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,400
I mean, like pension contributions,

1612
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,320
like it's it's becoming

1613
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,200
way more difficult for young people to own pensions.

1614
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:54,720
These guys think.

1615
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,640
But the truth is like

1616
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,280
so that kind of private asset in this country,

1617
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,640
the working class has never had like a massive share

1618
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,360
of those.

1619
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,840
You've kind of clicked something in my head, I get it.

1620
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1621
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,720
Like in a country like Germany or the US

1622
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,280
where there's more of a culture

1623
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,080
of owning stocks and shares for the working class,

1624
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,480
they will see more like they’re

1625
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,440
losing stocks and shares.

1626
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,000
In this country, the truth is, like

1627
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,000
the middle class never owned

1628
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,240
a huge amount, but like our generation versus

1629
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,240
our parents generation.

1630
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,880
But they were saving pensions more than we were.

1631
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,520
What you're saying.

1632
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,200
I never put those two together,

1633
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,040
that it's pensions that are stocks and shares.

1634
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,680
I never put that together.

1635
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,560
And I know for a fact that my generation...

1636
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,040
Nowadays young people,

1637
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,360
just increasingly just don't own stock and shares.

1638
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,040
That's what I was going to say.

1639
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,280
Like I don't know,

1640
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,440
I know very few people that have an actual pension.

1641
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,360
And my dad is always like, when we was your age,

1642
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,040
we starting building up our pensions. Yeah.

1643
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,280
But there's knock on effects, right?

1644
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:42,920
Which is like.

1645
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,400
Okay, you don't have stocks and shares,

1646
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,240
you don’t have a pension.

1647
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,880
Well, that means like, you can't

1648
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,160
you can't save much money, you know,

1649
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:49,840
and you can't

1650
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,280
you're going to drop your spending, right.

1651
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,040
Because you know, like,

1652
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,280
oh my God, like I don't have a pension.

1653
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,480
You know, I mean, I can't afford this.

1654
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,200
And then...

1655
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,640
it means

1656
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,240
and then also the rich just on the other side,

1657
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,520
this is side that doesn't get spoken about.

1658
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,280
The rich owning a shit ton is itself a problem.

1659
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,720
Because if the rich owned a s**t

1660
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,000
ton of stocks and shares

1661
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,920
as opposed to ordinary families,

1662
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,840
they generate s**t on of passive income.

1663
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,400
What are they going to do with that passive income?

1664
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,840
Buy the rest of the f**king assets.

1665
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,440
And that is why you're f**king...

1666
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,000
you can't afford a house, right?

1667
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,440
Like if you give these guys loads of money,

1668
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,360
the big thing that you see,

1669
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,040
if the rich and people think about this,

1670
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,280
if the richer a f**k ton of stocks and shares,

1671
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,760
of course you can't afford a house.

1672
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,400
Like if that guy's making

1673
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,240
£100,000 a year passive income.

1674
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Yeah, You know.

1675
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,200
You can't compete on that.

1676
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,600
Yeah, this is the problem.

1677
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,800
They drive the house prices up.

1678
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,880
And it's not that,

1679
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,640
I'm not anti wealth, I'm not anti wealth.

1680
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,720
But the truth is like the economy is not zero sum.

1681
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,960
But if it's growing very slowly like it is

1682
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,600
it's kind of zero sum. Yeah.

1683
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,760
And if these guys are getting more

1684
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,880
and more and more and more and more,

1685
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,800
they start to buy the things that you need, you know,

1686
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,640
why do you think it is

1687
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,600
that, you know, rents go up in London.

1688
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,040
Somebody is f**king paying them.

1689
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,840
It's the f**king rich people that are paying the rents,

1690
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,520
you know what I mean, and that's what they drive

1691
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,680
the price of everything that you need.

1692
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,760
Yeah that clicks that.

1693
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,400
The pensions thing

1694
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,360
that made that more,

1695
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,800
yeah, that's a good way of explaining that

1696
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,960
because I didn't I never even thought I was like,

1697
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,640
when did we have stocks and shares?

1698
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,200
But then I realise

1699
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,120
obviously pensions are stocks and shares.

1700
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,880
Yeah you're right. It's not it's a good point.

1701
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,320
People don't realise that. Yeah. Yeah.

1702
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:11,880
Well that's

1703
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,320
how ordinary people hold their stocks

1704
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,880
and shares, in pensions.

1705
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,760
It was kind of like, I've noticed that

1706
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,880
I don’t know, is their theory about this.

1707
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,040
But it's like

1708
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,480
I noticed the difference,

1709
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,880
so my wife's Ukrainian, which I bang on about,

1710
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,360
and they became capitalists in the 90s. Okay.

1711
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,120
And they're,

1712
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,480
they didn't,

1713
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,520
to give you perspective,

1714
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,760
They didn't have restaurants until like the 2000s,

1715
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,440
you'd go to like a canteen,

1716
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,200
and it wasn't going to be like state of the art.

1717
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,320
You just grab it and f**king bang it on a plate.

1718
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,040
In the 2000s, you see, like this insane rise.

1719
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,040
Well, really, it's sort of late 2000s into 2010s. Yeah.

1720
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,200
You see a rise in

1721
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,240
what you could probably call

1722
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,680
like early stage capitalism, where there's like a real,

1723
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,080
what people think capitalism is, which is go work hard,

1724
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,920
have a good idea and life will rewards you.

1725
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,200
That kind of exists in this sort of Wild West

1726
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,320
early stages of the Ukrainian economy.

1727
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,080
And so a specific thing I noticed, it's very specific,

1728
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,000
I don't know if it's too granular

1729
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,360
to make any grand points about,

1730
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,600
but is

1731
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,320
I notice that if you go to Ukraine,

1732
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,720
if you go to a cafe, you walk into that cafe,

1733
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,600
it will look perfect.

1734
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,800
It will be incredible.

1735
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,960
Every cafe, not just like one of them,

1736
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,360
every one of them.

1737
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,120
And you walk in, you go to the toilets.

1738
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,120
The toilets are immaculate. They cleaned, they are...

1739
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,120
I know this is very random, we’ll come back to it.

1740
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,920
Learning a bit about Ukraine. Yeah.

1741
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,760
You’ll go in, toilets are perfect.

1742
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,920
Smells nice. They have high quality soaps.

1743
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,720
You come back

1744
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,920
after you've taken your dump and you eat your food.

1745
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,080
Food's amazing, obviously.

1746
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,680
You wipe...

1747
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,680
I'm not just advertising Ukraine,

1748
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,480
there is a point here, you want your mouth.

1749
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,920
You put your tissue down,

1750
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,840
the staff comes, they take the tissue.

1751
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,880
Everything's perfect, right.

1752
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,360
You come to England,

1753
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,440
you go to the toilets of most cafes.

1754
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,080
They stink of s**t. There's toilet paper everywhere.

1755
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,200
And if you go to like.

1756
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:57,720
You know,

1757
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,560
you wait, you want someone to f**king serve you,

1758
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,200
you need to scan an app. The QR code doesn't work.

1759
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
They take ages to get to you.

1760
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,200
And I wanted to know, is there like this theory

1761
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,560
that when an economy is growing, they're competing?

1762
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,480
The belief in capitalism

1763
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,400
is that there's competition drives innovation.

1764
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,120
In the early stages of creating an industry

1765
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,240
does that competition create innovation?

1766
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,520
But when they've achieved their customers,

1767
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,280
they've got a customer base,

1768
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,120
I believe there's a crossover point

1769
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,800
where they stop innovating to compete for customers

1770
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,840
because they've got their market

1771
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,920
and they start looking for shortcuts to make money,

1772
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,560
which could be employ less people.

1773
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,160
It could be lower the quality of the meat in the food.

1774
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,120
Video games I noticed had a very similar trajectory.

1775
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,320
They were sick in the 2000s.

1776
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,880
Now it's all about loot crates and,

1777
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,360
you know, microtransactions and phone games.

1778
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,160
Is there a point when you, is there a name

1779
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,920
or is there a concept that once you reach, you,

1780
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,960
you've caught your audience,

1781
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,240
then you stop innovating

1782
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,920
and you start, like profit gouging, like you try and...

1783
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,600
does that make sense?

1784
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,560
It's a big question.

1785
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,680
And obviously, you know,

1786
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,920
Ukraine is not the only country

1787
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,240
which has very high service culture.

1788
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,480
I lived in Japan for two years

1789
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,480
and the quality of services is phenomenal.

1790
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,040
And we can sort of debate how capitalist Japan is.

1791
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,560
It's kind of a complicated question.

1792
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,440
I think,

1793
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,920
there is a thing that can tend to happen where I think,

1794
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,480
and I'm, you know, I'm not anti-capitalist.

1795
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,960
I'm not not pro capitalist.

1796
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,880
I try to just be pragmatic on things.

1797
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,120
Capitalism tends to work

1798
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,560
well when you have a lot of room to expand.

1799
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,200
And this is why, you know, I talk about being

1800
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,720
the dangers

1801
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,440
of high inequality and people,

1802
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,920
sometimes use a counter example,

1803
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,000
like the USA, which has high inequality and,

1804
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,320
you know, has had for quite a long

1805
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,480
time high living standards.

1806
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,520
You know, the USA is a, is still a quite a new country.

1807
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,040
And,

1808
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,880
you know, Europeans arrived there

1809
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,880
not that long ago and they were able to expand

1810
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,080
almost freely

1811
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,200
because they were basically able

1812
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,680
to take most of the land over time from the natives.

1813
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,480
So it's a f**king massive country to expand into,

1814
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,360
and it doesn't really matter

1815
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,280
if the rich, get really f**king rich.

1816
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,320
If you have like infinite land

1817
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,960
and natural resources over there

1818
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,200
because like, you can get really f**king rich

1819
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,360
and I'll just go over there. Start something new..

1820
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:35,960
Yeah.

1821
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:41,360
So like under that, kind of this like American context

1822
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,440
for a long time.

1823
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,920
Inequality like,

1824
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,600
didn’t really seem that dangerous, right.

1825
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,800
Because you can get as rich as you like.

1826
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,880
And this kind of concept,

1827
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,520
which is like politics of envy works right,

1828
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,400
which is like,

1829
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,560
you know, we go over there,

1830
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,960
you know, like for a long time,

1831
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,440
America was effectively infinitely large

1832
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,560
from the perspective of Europeans, right,

1833
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,320
because it was so big.

1834
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,640
And you could just keep going west,

1835
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,720
you keep going west,

1836
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,240
and there's more land, more land, more resources.

1837
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,400
Just go. Just go. Just go.

1838
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,280
That is very different to like,

1839
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,360
mature, advanced economy, like

1840
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,400
Britain's or increasingly like the US now

1841
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,960
where every square inch of land is owned.

1842
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,640
Yeah.

1843
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,480
That's I've heard something about. Yeah.

1844
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,560
You kind of connected a thought there,

1845
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,840
because I've heard that being called like,

1846
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,760
The New Frontier or something like that.

1847
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,880
So capitalism works by finding new frontiers,

1848
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,480
exploiting the frontier and then moving on to the next.

1849
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:32,640
Yeah.

1850
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,000
If there's,

1851
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,520
if there's, like another, if there's loads of land,

1852
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,080
it doesn't matter if you've,

1853
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,440
you've like settled here and you've made this yourself.

1854
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,040
There's this infinite that I can just keep going.

1855
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,720
But as soon as you run out of land, then suddenly

1856
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,840
people can't keep going anymore.

1857
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,280
And they need to find land and they need to find work,

1858
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,120
they need to find resources. Yes. And then also

1859
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,360
the rich are still expanding, right?

1860
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,080
Because the rich are still really rich

1861
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,920
and they're still expanding.

1862
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,560
And then what are they expanding into?

1863
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,000
Well, they're not expanding is empty land anymore.

1864
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,480
They have to take from somebody else, you know.

1865
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,560
So I think capitalism tends to work

1866
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,960
well in like young economies that are growing quickly.

1867
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,760
The problem is like

1868
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,680
when you kind of run out of stuff to expand into

1869
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,680
and then what tends to happen

1870
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,640
is then the rich start to take the assets of the,

1871
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,040
of the middle class and the poor, basically.

1872
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,400
One thing that I think is

1873
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,120
really, is quite interesting is,

1874
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,360
you know,

1875
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,920
I made a lot of money in my early, mid 20s

1876
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,360
and I did like a f**k ton of investments

1877
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,720
and some of the investments were like,

1878
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,040
oh let’s invest in a new company.

1879
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,120
And let’s build a new thing,

1880
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,160
let's build a new restaurant.

1881
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,400
And a lot of them were just like,

1882
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,080
let's just buy a property. And it's just buy gold.

1883
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,400
Almost all of the let's build a new thing failed. Yeah.

1884
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,080
And almost all of the let’s buy

1885
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,360
an existing thing worked really well, basically.

1886
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:42,720
And that’s,

1887
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,480
That's kind of what happens, right.

1888
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,800
Because when, once you've got nothing to expand into,

1889
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,240
well, it's much easier to just...

1890
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,040
because the rich are much richer than the middle class.

1891
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,040
Yeah. They can just out bid you. And that is what...

1892
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,640
this rise in house prices, rising stock prices,

1893
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,840
that is the rich outbidding

1894
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,280
the middle class for assets.

1895
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,200
That's why at the board games, man.

1896
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,880
Everyone should play a board game.

1897
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,760
It's very much like the end of monopoly,

1898
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,200
which is like, you know, it works fine.

1899
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,480
We’re all buying, we’re buying, we’re all buying.

1900
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,400
But then suddenly, like, these guys own everything.

1901
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,480
And, you know.

1902
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,080
It's so logical when you think about it is so logical.

1903
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,240
Yeah.

1904
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,440
Yeah.

1905
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,240
Well, I mean, you know,

1906
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,960
you look at history like earlier

1907
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,760
industrial evolution like it

1908
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,520
it wants to expand, it wants to expand.

1909
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,440
And that's why you saw like Europeans just...

1910
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,320
that's why colonialism happened in a sense.

1911
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,480
Like it's like we have all this s**t

1912
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,000
expand and go and like take them.

1913
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,800
But then eventually, like in a sense, you can view

1914
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,880
World War One and World War Two

1915
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,440
as basically like they ran out of world to expand into.

1916
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,320
And then once you...

1917
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,560
but because you're still growing,

1918
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,840
you still have all this like excess production,

1919
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,320
but you don’t have anywhere to expand into

1920
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,640
you have no choice but to fight each other.

1921
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,080
And it's like, okay, well,

1922
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,840
like, we've already taken over the world.

1923
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,720
You've taken over the world.

1924
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,080
There's no way to expand into.

1925
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,840
Well, but we still producing s**t, we have to,

1926
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,880
we have to go to war, basically.

1927
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,640
There's no other option. Like it's... Yeah, yeah.

1928
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,960
But what you see, what you're seeing now

1929
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,880
is like,

1930
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,080
the weak hands are being shuffled out

1931
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,360
and the weak hand is the western middle class

1932
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,840
and the western...

1933
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,240
To be honest,

1934
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,200
it's not a western elite, it's a global elite

1935
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,920
is just absolutely decimating the western middle class.

1936
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,720
So it’s the end of a poker game.

1937
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,880
Yeah, but then but then what happens

1938
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,440
when the middle class goes. Yeah.

1939
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,800
You know, once again

1940
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
they'll be in a situation where the rich....

1941
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,480
And that's the thing about capitalism.

1942
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,480
The rich will go at each other.

1943
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,360
I mean, I mean, that's you know, that's

1944
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,440
what f**king Putin is, right?

1945
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,160
That is the rich going at each other.

1946
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,080
And it's funny that these lot they,

1947
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,040
they have the access,

1948
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,760
they have the best access to information.

1949
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,280
And they should see the writing on the wall

1950
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,360
like it would be insane for billionaires. Don't

1951
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,720
please don't assume they're intelligent.

1952
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,840
No, yeah, I don't believe that. Like these guys.

1953
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,880
I think the best way to...

1954
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,200
I heard it described as like a Mongol horde.

1955
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:52,560
Yeah.

1956
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,280
Like these guys have money, they have power,

1957
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,560
they have resources, they want money,

1958
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,720
they want power, they want resources.

1959
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,120
They're not, you know...

1960
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,600
It's like it sounds cartoonish to say it,

1961
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,560
but they are so over driven

1962
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,800
by greed, their greed will consume them and kill them.

1963
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,840
Like capitalism will...

1964
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,240
But to be honest, it's more than the greed.

1965
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,720
They're just so f**king rich. There's...

1966
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,800
it's easy for them.

1967
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,440
Like they can outbid you on everything.

1968
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,520
They can out bid you on f**king everything.

1969
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,920
Like it's not it’s,

1970
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,640
like you know Rishi Sunak £700 million.

1971
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,000
What's the passive income on £700 million. Right.

1972
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,320
5% a year.

1973
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,360
He's going to be making £35 million

1974
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,400
a year, a half million pounds a week, right.

1975
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,960
Conservative.

1976
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,440
Yeah.

1977
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,960
It's not difficult to outbid

1978
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,240
everyone when you're making half a million

1979
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,680
pounds a week passive income.

1980
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,280
Yeah, yeah.

1981
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,040
In fact these guys won't even do it themselves,

1982
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,440
they'll have a family office

1983
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,200
that all they do is they just buys s**t, buys s**t,

1984
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,240
buys s**t, buys s**t, buys s**t,

1985
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,320
buys s**t, buys s**t, buys s**t.

1986
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,520
And your kid is out there

1987
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,720
working a job for 50 grand a year.

1988
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,160
He's competing with Rishi Sunak’s kids,

1989
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,320
who make half a million pounds a week passive income.

1990
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,440
And he's watching Andrew Tate.

1991
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,720
Thinking that he can f**king be with him one day.

1992
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,360
That’s mad. Yeah.

1993
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,680
Just to like make it very simple, right?

1994
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,240
Power f**king matters.

1995
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,920
If you allow that group to get really,

1996
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,960
really, really f**king powerful.

1997
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,040
Whilst your group is losing power.

1998
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,880
Eventually they'll take everything.

1999
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,640
And that is why the vast majority of human

2000
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,440
history is a tiny group of super rich elites

2001
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,280
and a massive group of impoverished peasants.

2002
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,400
Yeah, I don't know how people can like,

2003
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,160
hey should just understand inherently through...

2004
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,200
if you've even read any story in history,

2005
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,840
that's always been the case.

2006
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,960
But it's always been.

2007
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,040
It’s been a long time now, you know?

2008
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,720
But, you know, I read,

2009
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,400
I read a lot of classic books

2010
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,720
as I'm encouraging you to do.

2011
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,920
Go and read Dickens

2012
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,920
it’s only 150 years ago we had that here.

2013
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,640
That’s the craziest...

2014
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,840
the reading about that period of time

2015
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,960
that led to World War Two

2016
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,640
and then seeing the similarity.

2017
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,720
At the time of Dickens,

2018
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,200
the UK was easily

2019
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,920
the richest, most powerful country in the world,

2020
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,800
and your average British person lived in absolute,

2021
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,240
desperate poverty. Yeah.

2022
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:56,960
And to believe that

2023
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,400
that would somehow pan out differently is just.

2024
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,200
Yeah, it just ignores history.

2025
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,720
Every story of history.

2026
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,320
But, you know, the rich, they've got their own stories

2027
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,280
and they've got their own stories,

2028
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,680
and their stories are if you work hard, you’ll make it.

2029
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,520
Their stories are the reason

2030
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,880
you’re poor is because of immigrants.

2031
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,840
The reason you’re poor is because of foreigners.

2032
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,480
Their stories are just go buy Bitcoin

2033
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,680
and you'll be a billionaire, you know.

2034
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,440
You know they have their stories too,

2035
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,800
they have their stories too. But

2036
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,120
what they want is your stuff.

2037
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,360
And if you believe their stories, then they'll get it.

2038
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,600
But that's the power of story.

2039
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,720
And that is, that is why I do this YouTube channel.

2040
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,360
And, that is presumably why you try

2041
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,400
and do stories as well.

2042
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,800
And that's why I like my stuff is like, it's not

2043
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,800
I don't put just academic papers. It's I tell a story.

2044
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,320
It's like I'm making stories

2045
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,320
that you can relate and feel.

2046
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,400
There's music,

2047
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,800
there's like emotions

2048
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,480
because stories are the most important thing.

2049
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,480
And your story could be based on a lie or truth.

2050
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,920
And so I'm trying to put the truth into a story

2051
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,560
that makes people feel something

2052
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,560
that hopefully makes them think differently I suppose.

2053
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,400
Well, good luck with it. Yeah, and you bruv.

2054
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,160
Yeah. Thanks for coming on the channel.

2055
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:05,720
That was fun.

2056
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,560
Yeah. Good luck with your stuff.

2057
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,600
And, yeah,

2058
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,200
all the viewers, Jimmy the Giant,

2059
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,240
check his channel out on YouTube and,

2060
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,880
yeah, keep supporting us to make more stuff. Take care.
