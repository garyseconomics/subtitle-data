1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,560
Today we are going to talk about Elon Musk.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:08,920
Okay.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,560
So for those of you who don't know,

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,720
Elon Musk is the world's richest man.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,400
And he is the owner of Twitter and Tesla.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,640
And he has recently made his big entrance

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,400
to politics supporting Donald Trump aggressively.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,360
Donald Trump, of course, won the election.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,840
It looks like he will give Elon

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
Musk an official role in the US government,

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,720
and he has started intervening

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,720
quite aggressively in politics and a lot of countries,

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
including here in the UK, but also all across Europe,

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,680
generally supporting the anti-immigrant,

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,960
far right, right wing parties.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,000
And we're going to talk today

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,320
about what we can learn from that, from this,

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,080
this movement of Elon Musk into politics.

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,520
So I think the first thing

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,040
which we can learn about this maneuver

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,960
from Elon Musk is,

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,440
I think it's a really good

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,920
demonstration of something

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,160
which I've been trying to educate,

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,400
trying to illustrate a lot on this channel,

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,560
which is that when the super rich

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,080
get really, really rich, that doesn't not affect you.

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,200
It has an impact on you.

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,240
On this channel, we talk a lot about the need to tax

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,360
the rich more in order to protect living standards.

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,840
And we often get the pushback,

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,360
that's the politics of envy.

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,320
You shouldn't tax the rich.

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,680
It doesn't matter if rich people get rich.

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,080
We should focus on getting rich ourselves.

37
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,600
The rich being rich doesn't affect us.

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,280
And this is a really good example of why

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,520
the rich being super rich does affect you.

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,120
The rich get richer and richer and richer

41
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,640
and ordinary people owning fewer and fewer assets.

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,600
That affects you

43
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,560
because the rich are competing for the same resources

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,360
that you need.

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,800
There's only a certain amount of things

46
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,440
in the economy,

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,600
only certain amount of housing,

48
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,440
only a certain amount of education, universities,

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,400
doctors, dentists, physical space in the cities.

50
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
As the rich get aggressively richer,

51
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,240
they start to consume more stuff.

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,760
And that means less stuff for you

53
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,120
and the way that you normally see that is, for example,

54
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,400
housing in the cities gets more expensive.

55
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,760
That's because the rich are consuming more.

56
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,480
The rich are richer,

57
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,680
they can pay more, they push the prices up.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
But it's not just housing. right.

59
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,440
It's the same with, for example,

60
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,160
university education, access

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,840
to doctors, access to dentists,

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,200
access to space in the cities.

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,720
You know, you see here in London,

64
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,240
we see a lot of pubs closing down.

65
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,720
They're being replaced by generally housing.

66
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,040
Whereas if you go into the center of the city,

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
luxury hotels, luxury restaurants, theaters,

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,600
they're booming. They're doing better than ever.

69
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
What you're seeing here

70
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,960
is the rich competing with you for space,

71
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,040
out competing with you.

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,280
And the result is you get less space.

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,320
And the way that you see that is generally

74
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,520
the prices of things that you buy are going up.

75
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,280
And I think with this Elon Musk case,

76
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,120
we start to see another example of this,

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,920
which is the rich are also competing with you

78
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,800
for essentially the ownership of

79
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,440
your politics, your politicians and your media.

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,800
And this has always been the case.

81
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,240
It's the case also for economists.

82
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,400
So I studied economics

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
when I was a teenager

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,880
at the London School of Economics, which was...

85
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,400
which still is a big elite university here in London.

86
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,040
And I got very good grades there.

87
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,760
And I had a choice when I went to graduate.

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,040
Who do you want to work for?

89
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,800
Do I want to work for the government?

90
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
Trying to help the economy?

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
Trying to support the economy for ordinary people,

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,080
getting paid 40, 50, 60 grand a year?

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
Or do I want to work

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,160
managing the money of the rich,

95
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,240
getting paid 1 or 2 million pounds a year?

96
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,040
And it's not just bankers, right?

97
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,400
It's the same for dentists. It's the same for doctors.

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
I went to a grammar school

99
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,680
and a lot of my friends are dentists

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
and they can work in the NHS,

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,600
or they can do botox to rich people,

102
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,160
and they can get paid 3 or 4 times as much, right.

103
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,200
But it's also the same for politicians.

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
And I'm always reminded of David Cameron.

105
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,600
So I think the Prime Minister of the UK gets paid

106
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,720
something like £150,000 a year.

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,600
I think that's the salary.

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
David Cameron after he left office,

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,160
he went to work for a finance company called Greensill.

110
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,520
And I think within the first year

111
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,920
he made something like £10 million.

112
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,240
Now I want you to ask yourself,

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
why does a finance company

114
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,160
pay David Cameron £10 million

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720
one year after he leaves office?

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,800
Is David Cameron an excellent trader?

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,480
Is he an excellent financial analyst?

118
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
If your politicians are getting paid

119
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,320
100 grand a year, 150 grand a year by the people,

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,880
and they can also get paid £10 million a year

121
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,640
to work for the rich.

122
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,320
Who do you think the politicians really work for?

123
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,240
I'm also reminded of Rishi Sunak Right.

124
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,960
Rishi Sunak is a really interesting example

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
because his father in law

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,000
is one of the richest people in the entire world.

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,760
He's a billionaire, so he's...

128
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,840
the money which Rishi Sunak gets to be prime

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,480
minister is absolutely, totally irrelevant to him.

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,240
But the money that

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,600
his family will get from his father in law,

132
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,520
that is

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
clearly enormously his major financial interest. Right.

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,200
So

135
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,000
you’ve got to ask yourself then, when somebody like

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,640
Rishi Sunak is deciding things like,

137
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,200
how should we set tax policy?

138
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,880
How should we tax rich people?

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,480
Do you think he speaks to his father in law?

140
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,760
When David Cameron knows that

141
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,680
when he leaves office, he's going to work for Greensill

142
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,760
and get paid £10 million in one year,

143
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,520
when he's making these decisions,

144
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,880
do you think he speaks to the guys at Greensill

145
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,440
who are going to pay him £10 million?

146
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,400
So in the case of doctors, dentists, universities,

147
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,880
but also economists, also politicians,

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,240
you are in a competition.

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,600
The politicians can make a certain amount of money

150
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,920
working for you,

151
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,680
and they can make a certain amount of money

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
working for the rich.

153
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,360
And when the rich are super, super, super, super rich

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
and your average taxpayer is increasingly poor,

155
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,960
it gets harder and harder and harder

156
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,720
for you to compete with them.

157
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,760
And I think this is the reason why we saw

158
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,400
for long, long periods of time,

159
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,480
really high amounts of corruption in poor countries

160
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,040
because the local people of those countries

161
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,400
can't afford to pay their politicians very much,

162
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,160
whereas extremely wealthy people in other countries

163
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,000
can pay these politicians enormous amounts

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,600
to basically give the resources of those countries

165
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
to these wealthy people.

166
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,880
And I think this thing which has been happening

167
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,200
in poor countries for a long time, you know,

168
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
if you speak to people from

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,280
sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America,

170
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,200
a lot of places in Asia, that they've been seeing

171
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,720
this kind of corruption for a long time, in the West

172
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
we've been relatively protected

173
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,200
by that for a reasonable amount of time,

174
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,960
because we've had a wealthy taxpayer,

175
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,800
and we haven't had these super wealthy

176
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,600
foreign billionaires who can influence our politics.

177
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,560
As inequality has increased,

178
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,440
the taxpayer, ordinary families have become poorer,

179
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,200
the superrich have become richer,

180
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,560
and you have basically found yourself

181
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,000
in the same situation

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
that Latin Americans

183
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,040
and Africans have been in for a long period of time.

184
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,280
You cannot compete anymore

185
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,920
for ownership of your politicians

186
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,560
with the super rich,

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
and I think this is a classic example

188
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,560
of why inequality matters for you.

189
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,400
Because if you allow the super rich to get even richer

190
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,640
and you allow the middle class

191
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,840
to lose their assets,

192
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,520
they will increasingly outcompete

193
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
you for the things that you need.

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
And that includes your politicians

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,720
and includes your media as well,

196
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,480
it includes your media as well.

197
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
Now, if we consider the media,

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,200
if you work as a journalist,

199
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
you need to be paid.

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
Most people need to be paid.

201
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,760
They've got to pay the rent.

202
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
They've got to pay their bills.

203
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,960
There's two ways

204
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,280
you can be paid as a journalist, right?

205
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,280
You can sell journalism, sell news to the people,

206
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,800
or you can sell your services to the rich and say,

207
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,800
if you pay me, I will sell stories that promote

208
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
the ideas that you want to promote.

209
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,400
You know, if you are an American watching this channel,

210
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
you'll be very aware of where that ends up.

211
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,120
You end up with extremely biased media.

212
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,800
Their job is not to tell you the truth,

213
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
their job is to sell a certain story for you

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
because they get paid

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,240
by very rich people

216
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,160
who want you to believe certain things.

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,360
So this is the effect of inequality.

218
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,360
This is the effect of inequality. This is...

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,520
this Musk thing makes it really, really clear

220
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,920
how inequality affects you.

221
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,880
If you allow the rich

222
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,040
to get really, really rich

223
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,840
to get really, really powerful,

224
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,120
they outbid you for control of your politicians.

225
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
They outbid you for control of your media,

226
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,240
and they outbid you for access to your resources.

227
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,360
And then what you get is politicians

228
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,880
who don't care about you,

229
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,360
media who lies to you,

230
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,480
and the inability to access resources,

231
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,040
which includes things like food and housing.

232
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,120
And where does that lead us?

233
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,000
As soon as Donald Trump won the election,

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,840
Tesla stock price doubled.

235
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,880
Tesla's stock price doubled.

236
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,520
Why did Tesla's stock price double

237
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,480
when Donald Trump won the election?

238
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,400
Because traders think

239
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,160
that Donald Trump is going to use taxpayer money.

240
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,200
Your money if you're an American

241
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,960
to give to Tesla and to give to Elon Musk.

242
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,800
That is what inequality does.

243
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
Inequality

244
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,480
gives the rich

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
the power to directly access your tax dollars.

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
That is the end result.

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,440
That is why you need to care about inequality.

248
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
That is why you need to care

249
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
about the distribution of wealth.

250
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
That is why you need to care

251
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,000
about the distribution of power.

252
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,040
Okay, so that's my first point done.

253
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,280
Elon Musk makes it really clear

254
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,720
that inequality affects you in a material way.

255
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,120
The second point,

256
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
I wanted to talk a little bit about Elon Musk's

257
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
support of far right parties across the world.

258
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,960
When I say far right, what

259
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
I mean is anti-immigration parties.

260
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I know some people don't like the term far right.

261
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,520
Why is Elon Musk supporting

262
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,840
anti-immigration parties all around the world?

263
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,800
And to me, this is...

264
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,200
it's really, really obvious

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
why he comes in and supports that.

266
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
And I want to talk a little bit about it,

267
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,000
because I never hear this

268
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,480
discussed really in the media.

269
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,760
So on this channel

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
I talk a lot about, and I have been talking a lot

271
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,600
about for a long time,

272
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
the fact that the economy

273
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
is going to keep getting worse,

274
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,360
living standards will keep falling.

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,120
It'll be difficult for you to get financial security,

276
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,520
to get good quality housing, to get good quality jobs.

277
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,800
And because inequality will keep rising,

278
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,080
that will keep getting worse.

279
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,640
And I think

280
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,200
when I first started saying that, you know,

281
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
and I first like betting on this back in 2011,

282
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,480
that was a really

283
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,160
not popular opinion.

284
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,880
There was a general sort of consideration

285
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,760
that the economy was getting better

286
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,320
and it would recover. It would get better.

287
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,280
Now, as I say this, at the beginning of....

288
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,600
at the beginning of 2025,

289
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
I think it's becoming increasingly obvious

290
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,080
to people who are watching that,

291
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,200
that is what is happening.

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,120
The economy is on a structural downtrend.

293
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,240
Things are going to get worse and worse.

294
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,800
And as that happens,

295
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,000
it creates an obvious tension in politics,

296
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,960
which is that

297
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,360
people do not want to accept the situation

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,080
where their family gets poorer every generation.

299
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
People don't want their kids

300
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,040
to be poorer than they are.

301
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,200
People don't want their grandkids to live in poverty

302
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,840
and people demand change in politics.

303
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,560
And I think whilst

304
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,760
a lot of these kind of old school politicians

305
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,720
cling on to this hope that we can keep going

306
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,760
the way we're going,

307
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,560
it's becoming increasingly obvious to anybody,

308
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,920
kind of half smart,

309
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
that people are going to increasingly

310
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,800
demand some kind of change.

311
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,760
What that means is

312
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,680
we're kind of already in a situation

313
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,160
now in our society where there has to be a discussion

314
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,200
and there is already discussion about

315
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
where do we go, how do we change things.

316
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,720
And I think in the next

317
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,880
ten years, probably, maybe sooner,

318
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,240
you will see a significant change

319
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,840
in the way our politics is run,

320
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,280
what politicians offer and what people demand.

321
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,760
And that is because

322
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,040
the status quo is increasingly

323
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
obviously not working for most people.

324
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,800
So if you're somebody like Elon Musk

325
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,920
and you are the richest person in the entire world,

326
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,480
you're going to look at a changing world

327
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
and you're going to look at people

328
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,280
that are demanding different things.

329
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,960
You're going to look at people who,

330
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,880
people like me

331
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,040
who are demanding

332
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,920
less inequality, higher taxation of the rich, lower

333
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,600
taxation of ordinary workers. And

334
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,080
there's an obvious

335
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,840
reflex reaction for somebody like Elon

336
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,040
Musk where he says, well,

337
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,160
I don't want to pay higher taxes.

338
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,720
So I want to avoid this

339
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,920
outcome of higher taxes on the rich.

340
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,440
So you need to sell a different story.

341
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,120
And I think it's... it's

342
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,760
already really clear what the

343
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,760
big alternative stories are.

344
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,680
Our story, which is getting bigger,

345
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,840
the reason you're getting poorer

346
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,080
is because of the super rich,

347
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,040
need to tax the super rich more.

348
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,080
But there's one story which is much bigger than that,

349
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
which is the reason you’re poor

350
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,280
is because of immigrants.

351
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,880
The reason you’re poor is because of foreigners.

352
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,080
And if you are Elon Musk,

353
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
you're looking out there in the world of,

354
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,160
you know, new alternative economic ideas.

355
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,640
Which one of those ideas do you want to win?

356
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,520
Now, I would like to make it clear,

357
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,360
I think a sensible billionaire

358
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,560
would probably realise it's economically

359
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,920
destabilising to keep inequality growing more and more.

360
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,880
But most billionaires don't think like that.

361
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
They just don't want to pay higher taxes.

362
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,680
They want to keep getting richer.

363
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,880
They're kind of obsessed with it.

364
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
That's why they get rich.

365
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,760
So what are you going to do?

366
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,880
You are going to financially support

367
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,520
the idea that immigrants are the problem.

368
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
And I'm not...

369
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,080
I think sometimes people think that I'm

370
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,040
some sort of super pro-immigration guy.

371
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm not a super pro-immigration guy.

372
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,960
I recognise that it is massively

373
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,560
in the interests of the rich to tell you

374
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,000
that the problem is immigrants,

375
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
because if you don't think the problem is immigrants,

376
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,840
you might work out

377
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,000
that the reason you're getting poor

378
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,320
is because of the super rich,

379
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,440
and they don't want you to know that. So

380
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,880
this is the situation Elon Musk is in.

381
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,960
He's going to support that.

382
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,280
And it's the truth is,

383
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,320
and something increasingly worries me,

384
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,280
it's not just Elon Musk is going to support that.

385
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,680
You know, other super

386
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,000
rich people are going to support this idea

387
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,080
because they realise

388
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,640
that hatred of foreigners and hatred of immigrants

389
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,040
is the main thing

390
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,880
standing between them

391
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,280
and high levels of taxation,

392
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,240
and they don't want to pay more tax.

393
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,880
So they're going to fund it,

394
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,200
they're going to fund these ideas.

395
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,520
And more and more money is going to flood into that.

396
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,320
If inequality keeps increasing

397
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,600
and keeps increasing and keeps increasing,

398
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,160
living standards will get worse

399
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,280
and worse and worse and worse.

400
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,160
It will be extremely destabilising,

401
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,440
and it will destabilise an economy

402
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,320
which already provides

403
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,520
unbelievable levels of luxury

404
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,120
to the rich and the super rich.

405
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
I don't think this is the right

406
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,840
thing for billionaires to do.

407
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,080
You know, there's this story,

408
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know how true it is, that the reason that

409
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,840
the French

410
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,040
cut off the heads of the rich and the English didn't

411
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,040
is because the English accepted...

412
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,960
the English super rich accepted...

413
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,520
they need to give a bit back,

414
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,280
and they gave a little bit back to ordinary people.

415
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,240
They increased living standards of ordinary people.

416
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,000
And apparently that's why we still have a royal family.

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
And the French royal familiar are all dead.

418
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,160
I think a sensible billionaire would accept

419
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,000
that if they stop inequality from increasing,

420
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,760
we can stabilise this fall in living standards.

421
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,120
And they can protect their own situation.

422
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,360
But the fact is, most super rich don't think like that.

423
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,480
They very simplistically want to keep their taxes down.

424
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,480
I wanted to talk a little bit about where that puts

425
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,080
these guys, people like Musk, who are funding

426
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,760
and increasingly funding

427
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,720
anti-immigrant political parties,

428
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,400
anti-immigrant ideas because

429
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,240
what is interesting is

430
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,520
it is in their interests for people to hate foreigners

431
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,680
and for people to hate migrants,

432
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,040
and for people to think that migration is

433
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,920
the key problem.

434
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,920
But it is, interestingly, also in their interests

435
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,240
to keep migration high because

436
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,160
what these guys primarily need

437
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,120
is for you to hate migrants

438
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,880
and for you to think migration is the problem.

439
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,440
And the best way for them to achieve

440
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,280
that is to have loads of stuff

441
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,240
in the media saying migrants are the problem

442
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,240
and also to have really high levels of immigration,

443
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,520
because if immigration is really low,

444
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,360
first of all, it will rapidly become clear

445
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,880
that that didn't stop the economy from getting worse.

446
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
But secondly, it's a lot

447
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,040
easier to get people to hate migrants

448
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,720
when there's loads of migrants coming all the time.

449
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,360
And that is why you see

450
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,080
Trump in this really interesting situation

451
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,640
where he's simultaneously

452
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,840
funding anti-migrant parties

453
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,040
and arguing

454
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,000
that we need to have high levels of immigration

455
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,720
in the US.

456
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,440
And it really, really reminds me

457
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,400
of what the Conservatives did when they were in power.

458
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
So the Conservatives,

459
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,200
and I think this is the smartest thing they did,

460
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,240
and I'm surprised

461
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,120
in a way that they've got people

462
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,440
smart enough to do this.

463
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,840
The Conservatives really,

464
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,720
really fought hard to have a specific

465
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,880
kind of migrant kicked out of the country,

466
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
which was illegal migrants coming over in small boats.

467
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,800
At the same time, the Conservatives did Brexit.

468
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,560
Before Brexit, the UK has to accept EU migrants.

469
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,440
There's a degree to which the UK doesn't control

470
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,480
the level of immigration, of legal immigration.

471
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,680
After Brexit, the UK can choose

472
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,320
how much legal immigration it has.

473
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,840
So the Conservative Party basically had complete power

474
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,280
over the vast majority of migration,

475
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,320
illegal migration is only,

476
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,480
I think, 2 or 3% of overall immigration,

477
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,560
97%, 98% is legal migration,

478
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,000
which they could have reduced. But they didn't.

479
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,440
They did this

480
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,080
really interesting thing of

481
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,520
really aggressively trying to stop this really small

482
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,200
kind of immigration that they couldn't actually stop,

483
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,160
and massively increasing the number of visas,

484
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,400
which they gave legally to non EU immigrants.

485
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
It was like super, super smart.

486
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,880
They managed to simultaneously portray themselves

487
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,520
as the party of low migration

488
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,400
whilst massively increasing

489
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
non-EU migration to the country.

490
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,480
And I think this kind of

491
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
shows you in a way, what

492
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,960
the correct tactical play is from the billionaires.

493
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,000
Tell you to hate migrants,

494
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
and make sure there's tons of immigration,

495
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
because that makes you hate people,

496
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
that makes you hate immigrants.

497
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,280
And

498
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,560
I think the final thing that we learn from

499
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,480
Elon Musk is basically how important it is

500
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,560
for billionaires, that you guys hate each other.

501
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,080
So what I try to do on this channel

502
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,200
is to make it clear to you

503
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,480
that

504
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,120
the reason you're getting poorer

505
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,800
is because inequality is rapidly increasing.

506
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,080
If you don't stop inequality rapidly increasing,

507
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,640
you will keep getting poorer.

508
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,920
The only way you can really protect yourselves

509
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,160
is by working together

510
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,480
as a mass of not super rich people.

511
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,160
And using that political power,

512
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,480
that only works if you guys don't hate each other.

513
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,760
And every week I put these videos out

514
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,880
and I get people in the comments saying

515
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,080
that's never going to work.

516
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
People are never going to work together.

517
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
Tell me how I can protect myself.

518
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,160
Tell me what I can do.

519
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,040
Give me trading tips. Told me how I can protect myself.

520
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,280
Rising inequality, rising top 1% inequality,

521
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,880
means more and more and more of you lose every year.

522
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,360
There's no way to change that

523
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,920
other than stopping inequality from rising.

524
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,840
I think what people like Elon Musk want

525
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,720
is for you guys all to be living in this Squid Game

526
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
where you all think, I don't care

527
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,400
if only one of us will win and 99% of us will lose.

528
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,320
I want to fight the people around me to be in that 1%.

529
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,320
You need to change the game.

530
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,120
You need to change the game.

531
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,920
You cannot

532
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,960
play a game where every single year,

533
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,600
95% of you lose,

534
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,520
96% of you

535
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,920
lose, 97% of you lose,

536
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,440
and you keep hoping to be in that 1%.

537
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,280
You need to change the rules of the game,

538
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,080
and that means working together.

539
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,520
So to conclude,

540
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,240
Elon Musk is a great example of

541
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,280
why inequality is a danger for you and your family.

542
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,680
These guys are going to take the things that you need.

543
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,120
They're going to take your politicians,

544
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,320
your economists, your media,

545
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
and ultimately your housing and your food.

546
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
That is what it means.

547
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
You need to fight inequality.

548
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,560
The only way to do that is to work together.

549
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,200
That's why these billionaires want you

550
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,880
to hate each other.

551
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,960
If you hate each other, they’ll win.

552
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,600
If you work together, you can win.

553
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,040
Support

554
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,840
the channel,

555
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,120
tax the rich, cut tax on ordinary working people.

556
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,600
Send this to your friends, send this to your mum.

557
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,960
Thanks for your help. Good luck.
