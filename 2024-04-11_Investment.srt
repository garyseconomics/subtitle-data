1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,600
Today we're going to talk about investment.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,000
This is building on some stuff

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
we've been talking about about growth.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,680
And there's a question about, okay

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,640
how do you get growth?

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,920
You need to invest, invest to build your economy.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,080
Invest, invest, invest. Let's grow.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,680
And I think it's important to understand

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,080
how does investment work.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,440
Because I think there's a very simplistic

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,800
understanding of investment,

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
which is if you want to invest,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
you need to give loads of money to rich people,

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,560
because who does investments?

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,240
Rich people,

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,960
if you give loads of money to rich people,

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,080
we’ll get investments and we’ll grow.

19
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,160
If you look at the last 20, 30 years

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,920
when the wealth of the rich

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,960
has grown really significantly, investment

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,160
has actually fallen in many countries,

23
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,680
especially here in the UK.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,200
So why is it that when you give money to rich people,

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,240
it doesn't necessarily lead to investment?

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,760
But the first thing I would say is

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,440
when a rich person invests,

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
it doesn't necessarily lead to the creation

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
of new productive capacity.

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,400
So for example, if I make £2 million

31
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,600
and I use it to buy all your mum's houses,

32
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,480
it doesn't really do much to improve the economy.

33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,480
So rich people can simply invest by buying your assets.

34
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,280
And this leads us to thinking

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,000
and a little bit

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,520
of a more nuanced way about investment.

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,160
And for me,

38
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,840
when you want to create investment

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,640
to create new productive capacity,

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
there's basically two things you need.

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,520
Yes, you do need somebody

42
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,800
to basically fund that investment,

43
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,560
which is basically I'm going to use the resources

44
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,680
that I have to create something new,

45
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,560
to build something new, to build a new factory,

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
to build a new windmill,

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
to build the new diamond mine,

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,720
whatever, to build the new office block.

49
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,320
You need somebody

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,440
to say, I'm going to provide the resources

51
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,280
and in a modern society,

52
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,360
which is very unequal, that is often the rich.

53
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,480
But, you know, when you look back at the postwar period

54
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,800
when investment was much higher,

55
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,280
it could be government or it could

56
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,920
be, you know, a group of ordinarily non

57
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,000
super wealthy people putting their resources

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,440
towards building new things.

59
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,640
But it doesn't just require

60
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,720
people to fund the investment.

61
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,480
You also need profitable investments to exist.

62
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,680
So I have been

63
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,480
essentially retired ten years ago.

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
And since then

65
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,160
I've basically been living off my investments

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
and so I guess you could say I'm

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,800
a professional investor in a way,

68
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,240
although I think that's probably

69
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
a little bit of an excessive

70
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,840
fancy word to say, A rich person.

71
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,800
In that course of time,

72
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
I've done loads of different investments

73
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,520
and some of them were like productive investments.

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,080
Let's build something, that's create

75
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,920
something new in the economy.

76
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,960
And some of them were,

77
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,760
you know, I'm just going to buy existing assets.

78
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,720
I'm going to buy the stock market, I'm going to buy

79
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,160
gold, I'm going to buy a property.

80
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,000
And in the course of those ten years as an investor,

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,360
almost all of the times I tried to invest in actually

82
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
building new

83
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,760
productive capacity,

84
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,600
increasing the size of the economy.

85
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,280
I lost money, basically,

86
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,320
those investments almost all failed.

87
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,200
And almost every single time

88
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,840
I just bought stuff that already existed,

89
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,800
I made a ton of money.

90
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,240
The most profitable investment I ever did

91
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,200
was probably buying a ton of gold

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,280
at the beginning of Covid.

93
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,080
I made an absolute fortune on that. And,

94
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,640
I think it's pretty clear that me buying

95
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,640
a ton of gold does nothing to help grow the economy.

96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
And this raises the question of

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,160
why is it that trying to build new stuff

98
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
is not profitable,

99
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,200
but buying existing stuff is profitable?

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,560
And I think that is because essentially,

101
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,200
to make a productive investment,

102
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,120
a profitable investment, you need a customer.

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
At the end of the day it's not enough

104
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
just for rich people like me to turn up and say,

105
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,800
here's the money.

106
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360
You also need businesses to say, well,

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,360
we know that there's a massive customer base out there,

108
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,680
so we want to build new stuff for these people.

109
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,400
And I think the story of the last 20, 30 years

110
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,160
is basically the impoverishment of the middle class

111
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,480
and the ordinary British family,

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,600
the ordinary American family, European family,

113
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,000
Australian family, whoever you are,

114
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
at the expense of the very rich.

115
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,480
And that is why

116
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,440
trying to grow the economy has basically failed.

117
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,520
And if you look at this,

118
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,480
the parts of the economy

119
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
that have grown a lot,

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
it's almost exclusively

121
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,760
luxury stuff and services for the rich.

122
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,840
So I think

123
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,000
this sort of drive towards growth and investment

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,080
will not work

125
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,480
unless you deal with the fundamental inequality

126
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,880
that exists in our society.

127
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,800
And that is because

128
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,880
no matter how much money you give to the rich,

129
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,640
when they go to businesses and say, here's

130
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,680
the money, businesses are going to look and say,

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
well, where is the customer?

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
And if the only people they see

133
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,720
who are accumulating

134
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,560
a ton of money are very rich people,

135
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,640
even if we do build new productive capacity,

136
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,400
the only stuff they're going to

137
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,600
create is super luxury,

138
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
expensive stuff that you can't afford

139
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,520
that is for the rich,

140
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
because these guys have the money.

141
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,120
And I think what you need to understand is

142
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,840
a capitalist economy is very flexible.

143
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,200
It will provide stuff

144
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,440
specifically for people who have money.

145
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
You know,

146
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,880
I often think, you know,

147
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,160
since I started this YouTube channel, people like to

148
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,480
tell you go and be like Mr. Beast.

149
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,960
For those of you who don't know, Mr. Beast is,

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,720
I think, the most biggest, most watched YouTuber ever.

151
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
And he does a lot of stuff, like he goes to Africa

152
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,480
and he pays for like cheap

153
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,720
eye surgery for people in sub-Saharan

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Africa, in poor communities

155
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,400
and these are very cheap surgeries

156
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,600
that provide extraordinarily, phenomenally

157
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
significant improvements

158
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,440
in life for people in poor communities.

159
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
So if you think from an investment perspective

160
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,120
like this should be what we're investing in right?

161
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,720
Here are people who,

162
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,080
you don't need to put a lot of money in,

163
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,320
and you can really significantly

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
improve their quality of life.

165
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
So why don't we do that?

166
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,560
Why does capitalism, why do businesses,

167
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,880
not build healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa?

168
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,000
The answer is quite simply

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,480
because sub-Saharan Africans are poor

170
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
and capitalism

171
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,960
does not provide investment for poor people

172
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,080
because they want it to be profitable.

173
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,880
And the reason you should be worried about

174
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,760
this is because in the West, in the UK,

175
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,000
US, Europe, Australia, increasingly

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,160
ordinary people are poor.

177
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,120
You are poor. Your future is poor.

178
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,840
So if you want growth, if you want investment,

179
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,920
you're not going to get it.

180
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,320
Unless you deal with the fundamental fact

181
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
that you are poor,

182
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
you need to deal with the distribution.

183
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,040
Listen,

184
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,880
capitalism has for a long time not provided

185
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,640
anything for people in sub-Saharan Africa.

186
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,320
People in lots of Latin America, People in lots of Asia

187
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,760
because they were poor people.

188
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,960
And it was easy for

189
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
people like us not to worry about it

190
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,720
because we were the comfortable middle class.

191
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,960
Now we are poor. The average British person is poor.

192
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,160
The only way to get things

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,320
is to change the distribution.

194
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,800
If you don't change the distribution,

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
then all of that new investment

196
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,320
will be luxury

197
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,640
consumption, luxury properties, luxury holidays

198
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,000
for the rich and that is not going to help you at all.

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,160
So this relates to the videos

200
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,720
you've been doing

201
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,200
about the stupidity of growth,

202
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,000
which is if you focus only on growth

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
without focusing on distribution,

204
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,960
all you do is keep running

205
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,520
towards slavery at a faster rate.

206
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,320
Listen, there's a fundamental imbalance of power

207
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,200
and resources.

208
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,000
You are in a competition with the rich for resources.

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,080
If we're going to invest in this unequal system,

210
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,000
businesses will have a choice.

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
Are we going to build

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,520
healthcare centers in sub-Saharan Africa?

213
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,320
Are we going to build affordable homes

214
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,080
for poor people in the UK,

215
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
or are we going to build a sixth

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,600
helipad on the top of Elon Musk's f**king skyscraper?

217
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
You are going to lose that competition.

218
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
As the rich get richer and richer,

219
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,120
they will take the resources

220
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,000
and the investment that you need,

221
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,680
and the economy will turn into an economy

222
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,600
which provides only for them.

223
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,080
I don't know if you've seen The Hunger Games.

224
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,160
They have this city, which has one super luxury center

225
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,440
where all of the rich people live,

226
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,480
living lives of unbelievable luxury,

227
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,600
surrounded by terrible poverty.

228
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,840
Listen, that is what investment

229
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,240
looks like in an unequal society.

230
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,320
The only way to get investment

231
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,960
for you is to get wealth back.

232
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,320
To get power back

233
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
from the superrich into the hands of ordinary families.

234
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,520
And the only way to do that is to tax the rich.

235
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,160
And I know I say it millions of times,

236
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,640
and I'll say it millions of times more,

237
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,080
because until we do that,

238
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,920
our society will collapse into poverty.

239
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,160
Taxation is the only way

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,880
to escape poverty for your kids and your grandkids.

241
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,720
Tax the rich more, tax working people less.

242
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
Save the f**king future. Good luck.
