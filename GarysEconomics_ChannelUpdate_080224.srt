1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,240
Good morning, guys.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,120
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,440
Today we're going to do a channel up date for you.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,040
We've got a lot of things happening.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,560
I want to make sure you guys know what's happening.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,480
We're going to have some discount codes for you.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
There's going to be some Easter eggs at the end.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,840
Lots to talk about.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,240
The first thing to say is

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,440
just thank you basically for

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,640
the reception coming back.

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
You know, people always tell you when you're doing

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,720
YouTube, never take a break. Never, ever take a break.

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,200
Always release weekly videos.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,600
And that stressed me out, to be honest, because

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,760
it's difficult making a video every week.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,320
And I want this to be a big political project

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,000
and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep weekly videos up.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,200
You probably know that we took

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
six months off last year

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and that was mainly to finish writing the book off.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,240
But it was also partly because basically

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,400
sometimes I find making this channel quite stressful

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,520
and I needed a break

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,040
and I was worried that you guys might not be here

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,840
when I came back.

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,800
But we been getting more views than ever,

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,320
so yeah, thank you, everyone who's,

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,400
you know, waited for us to come back

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,240
and who still be there, who’s supporting,

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,600
who's spreading the message,

32
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,320
sharing the videos to your friends and family.

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,440
We appreciate that.

34
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,240
Second thing I want to say is

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
to talk about what's going on with the book.

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,080
In the last few weeks,

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,960
I've been doing

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,800
an unbelievable amount of book publicity,

39
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
which you won't have seen yet

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,080
because it's all being held back

41
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,200
basically to be released close to the time of release.

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,600
The book is coming out 5th of March.

43
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,040
Everyone is getting very excited.

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,240
We've had

45
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,320
photoshoots with three of the biggest broadsheets

46
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,040
in the country.

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
It feels like I've done interview

48
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,080
for basically every single newspaper in the country.

49
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,480
A lot of radio, a lot of TV.

50
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,280
It's all going to start coming in really quickly now.

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,640
So I wanted to talk about it on the channel

52
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,200
because basically in the next month

53
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,600
or so you're going to see a lot of me

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,880
on the TV, on the radio, in the newspapers. And

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,800
yeah, I wanted to make sure

56
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,720
you guys knew first and you were ready

57
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,640
if you want to keep up with what I'm doing,

58
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,080
we put this out on a lot of channels.

59
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,800
It's difficult

60
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,000
to post all of our media on a lot of the channel,

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,840
so you might want to follow me

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
on Twitter @garyseconomics,

63
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,520
and I'm going to post everything as it comes up.

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
We're going to try to keep it

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,320
on every channel so you can see what's happening.

66
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,640
But on things like TikTok,

67
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,920
for example it's not easy to post it, so

68
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't think I've mentioned it yet,

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,600
but we've got book deals in, I think so far,

70
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,480
ten different countries, book deals in the UK,

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
US, Spain, Germany, Netherlands,

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
Finland, Czech Republic, Japan, China and Taiwan.

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
So all of those countries,

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,320
the book will come out in your local language,

75
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
but the English language version

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,200
will be available all over the world.

77
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,280
I have to give a shout out

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
to my American publishers

79
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,080
because they have been working

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,000
really hard to make sure

81
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,120
that we get a discount code for Barnes and Noble.

82
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,760
There've been more

83
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,400
and more American viewers in the channel recently.

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
I see you guys in the comments.

85
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
I've been on those guys because I know

86
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
we've been putting out the Waterstones

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,880
discount code here in the UK,

88
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,440
but we wanted to say something for the American’s.

89
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,560
So there will be at the time this video comes out,

90
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,640
we'll have the Barnes and Noble discount code

91
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,680
for American viewers

92
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,080
and it will be in the description below.

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
So make sure, if you're American,

94
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,400
thank you for your support. Check it out.

95
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,120
I know some of you are here just for the economics, so

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
we appreciate your patience for the book stuff.

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,960
But I also know a lot of you are here

98
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,920
supporting the book.

99
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,840
Listen,

100
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,480
everything is getting very exciting with the book.

101
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
I think we've got a really big opportunity

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
to reach a huge amount of people,

103
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,280
which is potentially going

104
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
to help us really grow this channel.

105
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,880
So I appreciate everyone who supported the book,

106
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
everyone who has preordered the book,

107
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,960
everyone who’s excited about reading the book.

108
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,000
Basically, I want you guys to be along for

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
what is going to be a pretty big adventure

110
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,360
the next month or two.

111
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,920
Lots of publicity, lots of media.

112
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,240
Yeah, I want you guys along for the ride

113
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,640
and I want you to enjoy it.

114
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,240
I think it's going to be a massive opportunity

115
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,520
to bring this message to way more people.

116
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,960
We might be able to grow the channel

117
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,560
potentially a lot, touch wood.

118
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,640
And make this channel big enough

119
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,040
that we can start influencing politicians.

120
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,120
You know, we've got,

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
we've got an election later on this year

122
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,840
in this country and in America,

123
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,400
and it'd be nice to be in a situation where

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,360
I can start pointing to these guys a little bit

125
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
and tell them where they need to go.

126
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,840
And the book is an opportunity to do that.

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,880
So thank you very much for your support.

128
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,480
The discount codes will both be below.

129
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,240
It's coming out UK and US March 5th.

130
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
Yeah, come with me man.

131
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,440
I'll be posting all of the media

132
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,160
and it's going to be an exciting time for me

133
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
and hopefully for you as well.

134
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,400
The next thing which I have to talk about is...

135
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
I don’t really...

136
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I don't really like doing videos like this, but we hit

137
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,680
100,000 subs a few weeks ago,

138
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,360
so I wanted to say a big thank you to everyone

139
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,080
who has subbed to us, everyone who's been with us,

140
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,760
especially people

141
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,640
who've been with us a long time, since day one,

142
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,080
but also the new people as well.

143
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
But I also wanted to thank

144
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,000
Simran Mohan,

145
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,640
who is a friend of mine from high school, who

146
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,480
you see a lot of me on the channel, it’s a lot

147
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
my face, it’s a lot on my name.

148
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,640
But when I started this channel, it was June 2020

149
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,520
and at that time I was writing articles

150
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,640
for The Guardian and stuff and

151
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,840
basically I was getting pissed off

152
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
because I knew that,

153
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
you know, most of the people who are getting hurt

154
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,280
are ordinary people who,

155
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,120
you know, might not read The Guardian.

156
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
And I wanted to find a way to speak to,

157
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,920
you know, ordinary families

158
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,640
who are having their financial lives devastated.

159
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,920
And I really wanted to start a YouTube

160
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,400
and I was chatting about it on my

161
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,040
WhatsApp with my school friends

162
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,560
and a friend of mine named Simran Mohan,

163
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
who is a dentist,

164
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,640
reached out and said, look, I’ve got a camera,

165
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,760
let's just start shooting.

166
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,400
And

167
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
we shot videos together

168
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,640
for absolutely no money for a year and a half

169
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,440
and for very, very,

170
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,240
very little money for a year after that.

171
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,640
And he shot all the videos, he edited all the videos,

172
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,000
and we wouldn't be here without him.

173
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,640
And I know it's me on the camera and it's me, you see,

174
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,680
But in terms of hours,

175
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,880
it's him who put in a lot of the work.

176
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,000
So I wanted to give a shout out to him

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
to recognise 100,000 *subs

178
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,600
and also a shout out to all of you.

179
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,160
So thank you Simran, and thank you all

180
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,840
you guys as well.

181
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,880
Okay, I've got a couple of Easter eggs here,

182
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
so I wanted to answer a couple

183
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,920
of the most ridiculous questions

184
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,880
that we keep getting off on the channel,

185
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,680
which I don't normally answer in the comments.

186
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,720
Number one is, why do you wear that stupid hat

187
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
and those stupid gloves?

188
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,200
The answer is because it's winter and it's cold,

189
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,400
including sometimes in my house.

190
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,280
Number two is why do you speak in that stupid voice?

191
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,640
The answer is because I grew up in a stupid place

192
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
where everybody speaks in this stupid voice.

193
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,880
Those are the two Easter eggs.

194
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh last thing is, yeah, I've got my...

195
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,840
I've shown the book on the channel before, but

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
that was a fake book with a fake graphic

197
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,960
because they hadn’t actually been printed yet.

198
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
So I've just received from Penguin,

199
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,920
hot off the press, the actual books.

200
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,840
So we're going to do an unboxing here.

201
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,960
We're doing all the tricks today. Here you go.

202
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,040
Here you go, this is the real thing.

203
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,560
This is it.

204
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I don't know what to say, man.

205
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,520
Read it. You’ll like it. The last thing to say is

206
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,600
I know it's been a difficult time for a lot of people

207
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,000
and it's going to keep being difficult.

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,960
And I'm always aware when I make these videos

209
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
that I'm not

210
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,120
the person who's struggling

211
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,800
to put the heat on and I'm not the person

212
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,240
struggling to feed my family

213
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
or struggling to pay the bills, but

214
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
I'm working my tits off out here.

215
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,400
I know you haven't seen all the publicity I'm doing,

216
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
but I'm working eight days a week.

217
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,560
This is a massive opportunity to grow the channel.

218
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm working as hard as I can.

219
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
I really appreciate all the support.

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,840
I hope people support the book because

221
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,560
I think that's our chance

222
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,680
to take it to the next level.

223
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,160
Stay there for each other.

224
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,000
It's going to be tough times ahead, but

225
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,120
as much as I can, I'll be out here making videos, so

226
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
thank you for your support.

227
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,280
And yeah, let's get to a million. Thank you.
