This is the official list of authors for copyright purposes.
This file is distinct from the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file, as this lists the copyright holders; that file lists people.
For example, employees under a contract where the organization owns their copyright are listed there but not here.

Names should be added to this file as:

* Name or Organization (github-username or email-address)

Please keep the list alphabetically sorted by first name.

* Gary Stevenson (wealtheconomics.org/contact)
