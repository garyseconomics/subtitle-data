1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,400
You ready?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,120
Yep.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,840
Today, we are going to talk about the refugee protests.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Okay.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,040
Today's video is called

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,320
Refugee Riots, Salience and Storytelling.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,560
And what I want to do today is look at the recent

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,320
growth in refugee asylum seeker protests

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,960
here in the UK, and I want to use it to explain some

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,920
really important terms and concepts about media,

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,800
and in particular, economics and political media.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,640
We're going to talk about salience, storytelling,

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,600
wedge issues, and the bifurcated society, and

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,640
you're going to understand how the media works.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
Okay, so first, a little bit of

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,720
context for our international viewers.

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,800
In the last month or two, there have been

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,320
lots and lots of protests outside hotels which are

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,080
being used by the government to house asylum seekers.

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,520
Asylum seekers have come, they have not been

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
processed, and they're being put up in hotels, and

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,920
it has led to lots and lots of protests all over

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
the country by British people saying they're not

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,680
happy with asylum seekers being kept in hotels.

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,040
Okay, so for a long time, I avoided speaking

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
about immigration on the channel because I

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
am an economist, and I like to focus on the

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
economy and things which I'm an expert on.

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
But we started to see a couple of years ago

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,960
like the growth and the growth and the growth in

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,000
people talking about immigration in the comments,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,280
basically saying, "What are talking about?

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,440
The problem is not rich people.

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,280
The problem is not inequality.

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,000
The problem is immigration.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,720
Why don't you talk about that?" And we saw the

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000
popularity of this grow and grow and grow, and it

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,840
started to become increasingly clear that basically

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
anti-immigration sentiment was becoming basically

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
the key opposition to ideas about taxing the rich.

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,440
So, I did a video a couple of years ago,

43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,120
my first video on immigration, which

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,200
we'll link here so you can see.

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,760
And really, by and large, I haven't touched it so

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,480
much since, but I wanted to do a video on it now

47
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,520
because I think it's again become really relevant

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
to our work on dealing with the problem with the

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,720
economy, dealing with the problem on inequality.

50
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,680
And I think what we've seen is... I came back from

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,680
holiday about two months ago now, two and a half months

52
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,240
ago, and at that time, it really felt like we kind

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,640
of had our foot on the neck of the media, basically.

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,360
Everybody was talking about wealth taxes.

55
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,520
Everybody was constantly asking politicians,

56
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,360
"Why don't you do something about wealth taxes?

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,200
Why don't you do something about inequality?"

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,680
And there was kind of an effort made by the

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
media, especially by the right-wing media, to

60
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,840
kind of discredit the ideas on wealth taxes, and

61
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,880
really, to be honest, it kind of failed.

62
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,640
I think they didn't really successfully poke many

63
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,280
holes in the idea of taxing the rich more and

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,200
the idea of doing something about inequality,

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,520
and it felt like we had won the argument.

66
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,200
But then what basically happened was the media

67
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
pretty much stopped talking about inequality and started

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,520
to talk more and more and more and more about refugees

69
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,120
and asylum seekers and these protests at these hotels.

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,760
And what this teaches us is the importance

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
of the first media idea we're going

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,400
to explain today, which is salience.

73
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,320
Okay, so what is salience?

74
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm going to explain what salience is by

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,840
telling a story about when I first started

76
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,160
talking about economics in the media.

77
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,960
So, I started this YouTube channel in 2020, and at

78
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,160
the time, I started to do quite a little bit of,

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,560
like, radio, talking about inequality, talking about

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,880
the economy, I was lucky because I was one of

81
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,160
the first guys who realised there was going to be a

82
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,240
big inequality crisis, that there was going to be a big

83
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,360
inflation crisis, so I started to tell everybody

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,920
about it, and I went on loads and loads of radio shows.

85
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
If you look back through this channel,

86
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,400
if you like the really, really, really early

87
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,200
videos, we used to upload all of my radio

88
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,240
interviews, so you'll see them on there.

89
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,560
And you'll see, I was basically saying like,

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
years in advance, we were going to have an inequality

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
crisis and we were going to have an inflation crisis.

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,040
And I was in a really strong position basically

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,360
because I was a very good economist, I had a very good

94
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,160
history, I was one of the top traders in the city, and

95
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,960
economists who are this good basically

96
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,080
don't normally appear in the media because

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
they get paid a lot more to work for banks.

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,480
So in my personal opinion, I was

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
kind of head and shoulders above the

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,520
competition talking about the economy.

101
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,360
I went on loads of shows, I spoke about the

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,120
economy, I was doing really well, and eventually,

103
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,080
I got invited to go on with Nick Ferrari,

104
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,880
who is the most right-wing presenter on LBC.

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,160
So, again, for our foreign viewers, LBC is like

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,480
a really popular talk radio show in this country,

107
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,640
people call in,

108
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,560
they talk about the politics, mainly politics,

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,480
the economy, social issues, and they like to

110
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,240
consider themselves like neither left nor right.

111
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,760
They have like more left-wing presenters,

112
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,200
like James O'Brien, and they have more

113
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,960
right-wing presenters, like Nick Ferrari, and Nick

114
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
Ferrari is considered the most right-wing one.

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,120
And I got called up late one evening, I was

116
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,280
playing football with my friends, and they wanted

117
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,080
me to come on and talk about what I thought was

118
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,080
the economy, basically, and I broke my rib

119
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,200
playing football, but I really wanted to do it

120
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,920
because Nick Ferrari is like their big presenter.

121
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,240
So, I barely slept, and I went on early in the morning

122
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,640
on Nick Ferrari, and I wanted to talk about the

123
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,440
economy, I wanted to talk about inequality, I wanted

124
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,480
to talk about how COVID was massively increasing

125
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,000
inequality, how it was going to cause an economic crisis.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,520
And what Nick Ferrari did was he didn't allow the

127
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,800
conversation to ever be about anything except for

128
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,200
extremely narrow consumption decisions about what

129
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,240
kind of energy provider an ordinary family uses.

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
And every time I tried to move it to something

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,040
bigger about the economy, about inequality,

132
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,560
he was like, "What energy provider should

133
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,680
our viewers use?" Again and again and again.

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,720
And that is an example of salience, because salience

135
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,880
is not about winning the argument, it is

136
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,440
about controlling what topics are discussed.

137
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,080
It's about controlling the topic of discussion.

138
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,640
And once you start thinking about salience...

139
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,400
So, my background is not in media.

140
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
My background is in maths

141
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,920
and economics, and trading.

142
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
And in my heart of hearts, I'm like a

143
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,960
very sort of logic-y, mathsy guy, and

144
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,040
I think a lot of people are like that,

145
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,960
they think that political debate is about

146
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,240
debate and about winning the argument.

147
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,640
I make my points, you make your point,

148
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,120
and we, the public will decide who's the winner.

149
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,680
But what this Nick Ferrari interview showed

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,600
me is a massive thing that you can do is to

151
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,880
make sure you basically understand,

152
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,760
"What is it that my opponent is good at?

153
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,680
What area is he good at?

154
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
What area is he weak at?

155
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,840
What area am I good at?

156
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,320
What area am I weak at?" And you make sure that

157
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,640
you only ever speak about the area that you are

158
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,400
strong at, and you don't allow the subject to,

159
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,280
be anything that your opponent might be good at.

160
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,400
That is controlling the salience.

161
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Salience is basically how visible a particular topic is.

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,520
So rather than try to win the debate, you try to

163
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,600
make sure only one side of the debate is visible, has

164
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,040
any volume, gets heard, and that is the side of the

165
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,640
debate... side of the debate upon which you are strong.

166
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,960
And this idea of salience in a debate or

167
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,080
in a conversation, which if you keep an eye

168
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,800
out for it, you'll see all over the media.

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
You will see everybody doing it

170
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,960
in every political conversation.

171
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
It doesn't just apply to an individual

172
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,520
conversation or an individual debate.

173
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,920
We can apply it to the media as a whole, one media

174
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,440
show or basically, like, the whole media, like,

175
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,360
all of the TV, all of the newspapers, all of the

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
online, social media, what topics are getting

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
discussed and what topics are not getting discussed.

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,440
And back when I came back from holiday in late

179
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,400
June, early July, the economy and inequality

180
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,440
and taxation and taxation of the rich were being

181
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,520
discussed every single day on every single news show.

182
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,160
We had massive salience.

183
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,520
We were the issue that was being spoken about.

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,640
We were the issue that was dominating media time.

185
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,880
And now, if you look at the TV, what you see

186
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,600
is immigration and asylum seekers and refugee

187
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,840
riots, refugee protests outside hotels are

188
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
being spoken about much, much, much more.

189
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,240
And issues of inequality, taxation, distribution

190
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,400
have kind of been put on the shelf, which basically

191
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,360
means we, as much as we maybe won the argument on the

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,720
economy, we are now losing the battle for salience.

193
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,680
So, how do you win the battle for salience?

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,400
And that brings us to my next important

195
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
point, which we're going to discuss about

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,880
the media, which is storytelling.

197
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay, so storytelling.

198
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,000
Now, I, if you have been watching for a long time,

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,480
you'll know this, or if you go back and watch some

200
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,200
of our older videos, I have been saying for years

201
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,640
that in this country what would happen was,

202
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,960
Rishi Sunak would fail really badly for popularity.

203
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,400
Keir Starmer and Labour would

204
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
have a massive electoral win.

205
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Then Keir Starmer and Labour would fail really

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,480
badly, and then Nigel Farage and Reform would win.

207
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,840
I've been saying this for years.

208
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,920
I said this is, right back when

209
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,080
Boris Johnson was still prime minister

210
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,240
and Rishi Sunak was coming in.

211
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,960
So I've made a lot of very good, correct predictions

212
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,120
on politics, which were not consensus at the time.

213
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,920
And the way I've been able to make these correct

214
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,960
predictions is simply through understanding two

215
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,560
things, which is the economy and storytelling.

216
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,720
Okay, so it wasn't particularly difficult to predict

217
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
the failure of successive UK governments if you

218
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,360
understand our basic economic problem, which is we have

219
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,000
rapidly growing inequality of wealth that is sucking

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
wealth out of the middle class and the government,

221
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
which is sucking spending power out of the economy.

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,720
It's accumulating wealth with the very rich,

223
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,440
which is driving asset prices up, which is

224
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,200
making it harder for ordinary people to live.

225
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,080
Because we knew that both Rishi Sunak and the

226
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,000
Conservatives and Keir Starmer and Labour would come

227
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,880
in and do nothing about this growing inequality, we

228
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,960
basically knew that they would fail economically.

229
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,200
It's like you've got a hole in the bottom of your boat.

230
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Wealth is sucking out of that hole at

231
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,680
an unbelievably rapid accelerating pace.

232
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,880
If you don't patch that hole, you're going to fail.

233
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,920
So it was relatively easy to know that we would have

234
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,200
a sequence of failing governments.

235
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,880
But how was I able also to predict the rise of

236
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,040
Reform and the rise of Nigel Farage, who for

237
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,520
those of you who might not know, who are not from the UK,

238
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,040
are our sort of new far-right party and leader?

239
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
That was because I understood

240
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,040
the importance of storytelling.

241
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,840
So when you have an economic crisis, especially

242
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,920
what we have had in the last 5, 10, sort of coming

243
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,840
up to 20 years now, a long-term economic crisis,

244
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,240
which seems protracted, feels like it has no

245
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,480
end, feels like it's going to get worse and worse,

246
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,960
ordinary families are really struggling, you

247
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,080
create this urgent need in the mind of the public

248
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,280
for something new, something different, right?

249
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,560
People do not want their... People can have a sense

250
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,760
for, like, the direction that their country is headed

251
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,400
and the direction that living standards are headed.

252
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,160
And if you go to a place like India or like China,

253
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,280
where living standards have for a long time been worse

254
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,720
than they are in the UK, because people have a sense

255
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,400
that life is getting better and their kids will be

256
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,840
richer than they are, they're happy to accept that.

257
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,040
But when people sense that their life is getting worse,

258
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,240
people really worry and people don't consider

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,480
that to be acceptable and they want something different.

260
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
And what people think they want is, like, a

261
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,320
new economic model or a new way of dealing

262
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
with the economy that doesn't collapse.

263
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
But the truth is... or maybe they

264
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,880
want a new political system.

265
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,760
But the truth is most people are not

266
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,640
experts on the economy and politics, and

267
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,400
what people really want is a new story.

268
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,880
People want there to be a new story that does

269
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,120
not involve their kids being poor, that does not

270
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,360
involve them getting worse and worse off over time.

271
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,480
And it creates this massive

272
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,040
demand for basically a new story.

273
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,840
There's this quote that I use from Milton Friedman,

274
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,000
the American economist, which is, "At times of

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,520
crisis, the solution will be chosen from the ideas

276
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,200
lying around at the time." If you have a collapsing

277
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
economy, it creates what I think of as a kind of

278
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,160
economic boom for stories and ideas, which is when

279
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,360
people are extremely unsatisfied with the status quo,

280
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,640
they start to look around and think, "Well, what are

281
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,680
our other options?" And that meant that because

282
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,880
we knew we would have a sequence of failing

283
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,000
governments, because the governments wouldn't deal

284
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,200
with growing wealth inequality, anybody who could

285
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,720
put together a compelling story that was different,

286
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,240
that was new, would inevitably get drawn into power.

287
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,320
And what really matters with regards to

288
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
these stories is, again, the salience.

289
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,000
So when the economy is collapsing, lots of different

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,880
people will have lots of different ideas about

291
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,040
how do we fix the economy, and basically, whichever

292
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,120
one is loudest is going to be the guy that will win.

293
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,520
When you understand this basic idea, number

294
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,200
one, until we deal with growing inequality,

295
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
living standards continue to worsen, which means

296
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,640
we have this continuing sense of collapsing

297
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,800
economy and desperate need for change.

298
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,440
You kind of always know what's going to happen

299
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,560
in politics, which is whoever is the loudest

300
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,240
alternative voice at any point in

301
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,720
time is going to win the next election.

302
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,000
And Labour won the last election with a very,

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,840
very simple story of the Conservatives are really

304
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,320
****, let's kick them out, and that basically won.

305
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
And that was, that was the

306
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,280
dominant story at the time.

307
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,040
But then Labour come in, and you get this even deeper

308
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,880
kind of story power vacuum essentially, which is

309
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,680
in this country, we've only had one... we've only had two

310
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,840
political parties in power for nearly a hundred years

311
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,480
essentially, and one of them was massively discredited.

312
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
Then the other one comes in, basically

313
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,480
purely on the story of we are not the first

314
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,840
party, and they become massively discredited.

315
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,800
And really, you end up in a situation of

316
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,680
whoever can control the media salience,

317
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,240
whoever has the biggest story of being new

318
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,280
and different will become Prime Minister.

319
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,480
And if you look at the situation now,

320
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,560
it was always pretty clear that Nigel Farage

321
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
and Reform and the far right would win.

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
And I want to be clear when I say

323
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
that this is not at all UK-specific.

324
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,360
The same thing is happening in basically

325
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,040
every country in the entire Western world.

326
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,760
When your center-left has no story and your

327
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,560
center-right has no story, really, anyone else

328
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,320
who has a compelling story can basically walk

329
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
into your president's or prime minister's office.

330
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
So that is where we are basically.

331
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,600
We have this collapsing economy.

332
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
We have this vacuum of stories, and it becomes, in

333
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,640
a bizarre way, like fantastically easy to become

334
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,880
president or prime minister, and that is why you're

335
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,480
seeing across the world sort of random guys who are

336
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
not even politicians, not even political parties

337
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,080
which didn't even exist recently, suddenly turning

338
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,200
up, becoming president, becoming prime minister.

339
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,720
You know, you saw Macron in France.

340
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,600
We saw Trump in the US.

341
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
We've seen the collapse of... You know, we've seen

342
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,640
the rise of the far-right parties basically across

343
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,040
Europe, new political parties taking power in Italy.

344
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,160
When the economy is collapsing,

345
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,120
anyone who can tell a compelling story

346
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,440
will be able to take control of that country.

347
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,680
And the problem with that at the moment is, really, if

348
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,720
you look around the political world at the moment, there

349
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,000
are basically no loud stories other than the far right.

350
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,440
So the far right has, like a pretty

351
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,720
clear story that everybody knows.

352
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,960
Like if I were to pull someone in in my country and say,

353
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,880
"What do you think Nigel Farage or Reform stands for?

354
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,000
What do they believe?" If I did the same thing in

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,160
your country, wherever you were, people would know.

356
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,160
They'd say they want there to be lower immigration.

357
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,200
They want there to be, fewer asylum seekers.

358
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,960
You know, that, that's like, that's what they want.

359
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,040
It's, it's really, really clear.

360
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,400
But if I was to ask somebody, "What is the story

361
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,160
of Labour or Keir Starmer in this country?"

362
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,360
If I were to ask somebody, "What is the

363
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,640
story of the Democrats in your country?"

364
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't think they would know,

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,240
You know, and there are

366
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,720
groups of politicians in society.

367
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,920
You know, I went on The Rest Is Politics

368
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,720
a few weeks ago, which is the biggest

369
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,320
politics podcast here in the UK.

370
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,720
If you watch, if you want to see it,

371
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,200
you can... The video's there online.

372
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,000
And it's a very high-profile podcast,

373
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,480
and it's two sort of centrist politicians.

374
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,280
One is from the center-left

375
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,680
party, one is from the center-right.

376
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,920
They're... neither of

377
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,480
them active in politics anymore.

378
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,960
You go on there, there's a lot of hand-wringing

379
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,160
about the failures of Labour, the failures

380
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,680
of the Conservative Party, the failures

381
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,160
of the far right, Reform and Nigel Farage.

382
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
And for all that they like to criticise the

383
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,760
existing political system, what is their story?

384
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,200
What is their story?

385
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,280
I mean, I think it seems to be

386
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,480
largely about criticising other groups.

387
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
So that, that's where we are.

388
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,360
You know, if we talk about the left, if I

389
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,920
was to bring someone in on the street and say, "What do

390
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,560
you think, you know, the left believes in this country?

391
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,240
What is their story?" You know,

392
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,720
differentiating a little between the center and

393
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,800
the center-left and the left, the center-right,

394
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,880
the Conservatives are basically dead.

395
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,760
Really, what you have is you only have one group

396
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,280
that has a story, and people get behind that story.

397
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,160
They support that story.

398
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,560
In the absence of competing

399
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,600
stories, basically, you win.

400
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,920
So we have this period of time where there's

401
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,200
this massive absence of stories, which creates

402
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,840
this unbelievable power of storytelling, and

403
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,840
yet seemingly no group in society other than

404
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,960
the far right has been able or is able to

405
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,840
tell a compelling political economic story.

406
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,080
So now we've established these two really important

407
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,400
concepts that you need to understand if you want to

408
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,800
take political power, salience, and storytelling.

409
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,600
I want to talk about another element which, the far

410
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,160
right and the refugee protesters have, have

411
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,640
done really well in understanding these concepts.

412
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,920
So one of these protests, which they're very

413
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,520
regular now, is super, super close to where I

414
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
live, and, and I went down there with, with Jack the

415
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,560
cameraman, who films these videos, a few weeks ago.

416
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,720
To be honest, more than anything, just to sort of

417
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,280
witness what was happening because, I was worried,

418
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,080
I am worried about this sort of, growing movement.

419
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,600
And one thing that I found really, really

420
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,360
interesting that I saw there was there were enormous...

421
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,840
The actual number of protesters... So there were

422
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,800
protesters protesting against hotels and there were

423
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,320
counter-protesters, protesting against the protesters.

424
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,160
The number of protesters was not that huge, but what

425
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,440
there were a huge number of was citizen journalists.

426
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,040
And what I mean when I say citizen journalist is

427
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,320
somebody who's not presumably professional journalist.

428
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,880
Just a guy or a woman with a camera, sort of

429
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,720
live streaming, doing selfies, showing the, showing

430
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
the protest, and uploading the video to Facebook.

431
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,280
And there were loads and loads and loads of these guys.

432
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,120
And it was really, really noticeable how

433
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,040
much media presence there was relative to

434
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,360
what was actually a relatively small protest.

435
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,000
And I think what that shows is basically that the,

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,840
the far right has done a much better job, in a

437
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,840
sense, of understanding storytelling and salience.

438
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,240
And also understanding a thing which

439
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
I've spoken about a lot on this channel,

440
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,680
which is the need to be present online.

441
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,880
So, I think a thing has happened in media,

442
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
especially politics media in the last few

443
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
years, which is there has been

444
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
a massive shift towards online media.

445
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,880
I think this has really accelerated during COVID, which

446
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,280
is more and more and more people want to get their

447
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,240
news online, on Instagram, on YouTube, on Facebook.

448
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,080
And it has created this real opportunity

449
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,480
to aggressively dominate the salience of online

450
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,600
platforms because the existing media institutions

451
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,280
like BBC, Sky News, the existing political

452
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,400
parties have just been slow to move into it.

453
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,960
And what this... or what is interesting about these

454
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,000
citizen journalists is these citizen journalists

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
individually, the vast majority of them, won't

456
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
get anything like the number of views that we

457
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,120
get on this video that we get on our channel.

458
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,680
But the way that they succeed is that

459
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,320
there is simply an enormous amount of them.

460
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,640
And I think what this shows is in a weird

461
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,240
way, it's kind of inspirational because I've been

462
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,440
saying for a long time... you know, I made the decision

463
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,720
rather than writing for the big newspapers, to

464
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,920
try to do a push for online and a push for social.

465
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,640
Because I felt that that's where people were.

466
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
And recently, I've been trying to encourage our

467
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,520
viewers, you, to create more yourself and to make

468
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,880
more videos yourself and throw things out there.

469
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,760
And that is basically because people

470
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,000
are online nowadays, and there is,

471
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,520
there's this massive space.

472
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,240
I think what, what you see is

473
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,200
stories... stories are these really interesting things.

474
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
Stories are kind of like, they're

475
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,680
like a computer virus in a way.

476
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,400
Like, we like to think that the media

477
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,120
comes in and decides what stories get placed where.

478
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,400
But as the media has lost power and people have

479
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,960
moved online, you're kind of seeing it's more like

480
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,280
a kind of like a virus model, almost like this COVID

481
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,960
model, which is if enough people get out there and

482
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,680
spread it, it can spread really, really quickly.

483
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,760
And you can dominate the salience of a subject

484
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,600
without necessarily having that top level media support.

485
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,000
And I think that is what the far right

486
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,920
have done super, super, super, super well.

487
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,960
And they've created this kind of...

488
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,960
I mean, obviously, they do have media support.

489
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,080
They do have financial support.

490
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,880
We have things like GB News in this country, which

491
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,000
is, you know, a very well-funded, loss-making

492
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,200
media channel that supports these far right ideas.

493
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,160
You have obviously people like Elon Musk

494
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,680
buying things like Twitter.

495
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,440
But they have really effectively spread these

496
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,480
messages from the ground up, from the bottom.

497
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,240
And I think really we need to learn a lesson

498
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,600
from these guys, which is I think people like me,

499
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,240
I need to be constantly making these ideas, these

500
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,240
messages, these... the idea that the problem is

501
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,920
inequality, the idea that living standards will get

502
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,320
worse because of growing inequality, I need to make

503
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,360
that as simple as possible again and again and again.

504
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,920
So that people like you can take

505
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,600
the message and run with it.

506
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,280
I think what you've seen also with these guys is

507
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,560
basically the importance of being, like, multi-platform.

508
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,400
So we're really popular on YouTube.

509
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,360
We're really popular on Instagram.

510
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,920
We're popular with like basically younger

511
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,840
people, people in their 20s, 30s, 40s.

512
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,480
We're less popular with older

513
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,960
people in their 50s or 60s.

514
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,800
And that is largely because those guys are on

515
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,280
Facebook, and we are not popular on Facebook, basically.

516
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,000
So what you have seen is, and this is the last

517
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,120
concept I need to add before I get onto, well, one

518
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,480
more, phenomenal ability to craft a simple message,

519
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
give it to ordinary people, and this unbelievable

520
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,480
message discipline around the simple message to

521
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,960
flood the zone, tell everybody the problem is

522
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,400
immigrants, get everybody down to the protest,

523
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
make your videos, put them on Facebook, tell

524
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,160
your friends, tell your family, tell your mum.

525
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,240
And what you've basically seen is the far right

526
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,400
using basically exactly the model that I've been

527
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,480
saying we need to do for years, which is we put

528
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,760
a message out on here and all of you take it,

529
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,160
run with it, make your own videos, spread it in

530
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,200
your community, spread it amongst your family.

531
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,800
And what they've shown is it works.

532
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,760
It works.

533
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
And, we need to do it.

534
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,920
We need to do it better.

535
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,800
We need to copy them.

536
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,160
So to be clear here, I am trying to make a pitch

537
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,480
that essentially this needs to be the story.

538
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,640
The story needs to be growing inequality

539
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,120
of wealth is destroying living standards.

540
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,240
If you don't do anything about the

541
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,040
billionaires, your kids will be poor.

542
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,560
We've got plenty of videos out there

543
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,840
that I think support that story.

544
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,240
The best ones are probably The Squeeze Out or

545
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,800
the Channel 4 video with Krishna Guru-Murthy.

546
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,560
But we need to get behind this.

547
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
We need message discipline.

548
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,680
And I want this video...

549
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,320
Really, this is a call-out to the

550
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,840
left, to the center, to the centrist dads.

551
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,760
If you want to stop Nigel Farage from winning the

552
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,800
next election, you need to get behind a story.

553
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,000
You need a story.

554
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,480
I think we are the second loudest story in the room.

555
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,200
I think we are a story that can win.

556
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,520
But we need you to get behind it.

557
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,280
We need some message discipline.

558
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,720
We need people to be willing to

559
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,320
put their egos down for a little bit,

560
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,880
pick the message that's going to win, get behind it,

561
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,560
get out there, make the videos, get spreading it.

562
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,840
Because if we do not win the battle for salience,

563
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,240
we will lose the control of the country.

564
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,880
The last thing I wanted to talk about was

565
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,240
introduce this concept of a bifurcated society.

566
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,080
And this is something which I've been thinking

567
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,720
about a lot recently, which is the idea that

568
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,240
as wealth and equality increases, it kind of splits

569
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,440
society into two groups, which is wealth gets sucked

570
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,320
out of ordinary families and they start to become poor.

571
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,920
But you have this group of societies, this group of

572
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,360
families at the top which become unbelievably wealthy,

573
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
and as the top gets richer and the rest get poorer,

574
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,520
these groups kind of separate off from one another.

575
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,840
And what that leads to is a situation where all of

576
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,520
these elites in society, which includes the politicians

577
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,320
and the policymakers and the economists, basically

578
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,960
have a very poor understanding of what is happening in

579
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,280
ordinary people's lives, and it makes them basically

580
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,480
unable to sort of view these people with compassion.

581
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,360
I'll be thinking about this more through going to

582
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,240
these protests and talking to people at the protests.

583
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,680
Because what I found when I went to the

584
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,880
protests was a lot of people who have had a very

585
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,160
difficult time in the last few years, and

586
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,000
in particular had a difficult time during COVID

587
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
and since COVID, that have become very, very

588
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,120
distrustful of the societies that they live in.

589
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,480
And what struck me really was how in many cases

590
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,080
they were kind of right to be distrustful because

591
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,880
they think the politicians don't care about

592
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,800
them, and to a degree, that's right.

593
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,400
The politicians don't care about them.

594
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
They feel like they're ignored,

595
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,680
and to a degree, that they are ignored.

596
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,760
They feel like their financial position is

597
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,080
bad and their financial futures are uncertain,

598
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,760
and those are true facts as well ,

599
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
and they don't really understand why.

600
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,400
And I think it's important to recognise that if

601
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,400
you put somebody in that kind of situation where

602
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,600
their life is insecure, their future is insecure, their

603
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,200
family's insecure, things are changing, they don't

604
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,240
understand why, they don't feel connected at all to the

605
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,440
media or the TV or like they're having the situation

606
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,640
explained to them, it's kind of normal to go crazy.

607
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,560
And this reminded me, so I've not spoken about

608
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,840
this much on the channel, but my parents are

609
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,680
Mormons, and, Mormonism is a kind of a, a very

610
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,000
strict kind of American Christianity.

611
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,280
And what's interesting about that is a

612
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,360
lot of people think that Mormonism only exists

613
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,680
in America, but there's actually a lot of

614
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,800
Mormon- a lot of Mormons all over the world.

615
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,520
And the reason that there's a lot of Mormons all over

616
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,720
the world is the Mormons send young men and young

617
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,000
women dressed in very smart sort of white shirts

618
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,240
all around the world to knock on people's doors and

619
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,720
to tell them, "Hey, do you want to become a Mormon?"

620
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,440
And it is surprisingly successful, and three

621
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
of my grandparents were converted to Mormonism

622
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,360
by these guys who came knocking on their doors.

623
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,440
And sometimes I've wondered, you know, what

624
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,640
it was about, you know, my dad's parents

625
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,360
are very sort of stiff-upper-lip, English,

626
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,240
working-class people, why they became Mormons.

627
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,200
But, you know, my grandad, he came back from

628
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,640
the war, he was, he was a mem- he was in the

629
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
army since before the war started, you know, he

630
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,440
probably killed people in Egypt, and I think maybe

631
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,520
he was in a bit of a confused emotional space.

632
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,800
And you get a couple of young preppy-looking Americans

633
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,480
in nice smart shirts knock on your door and say,

634
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
"Hey, you know, we're going to teach you about God.

635
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,960
Come with us.

636
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,440
We're going to give you a community.

637
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,480
We're going to give you a space where you feel safe.

638
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,680
We're going to give you a future" I think if you

639
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,840
put someone in a space where they feel unprotected

640
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,800
and unsupported and confused, and somebody

641
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,840
knocks on their door with a smiling face and a hand

642
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,120
out, and says, "We're going to be here for you, we're

643
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,960
going to support you" a lot of people are going to go.

644
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:37,200
And when I went down to that protest

645
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,360
When I went down to that protest and

646
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,920
I saw the protesters on one side

647
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,640
and the counter-protestors on the other side

648
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,680
shouting each other and calling each other names,

649
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,720
I found it quite upsetting, to be honest, and I couldn't

650
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,760
help but ask myself, "Before I call these people

651
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:05,120
names, have I knocked on their door with my hand out?

652
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,840
Have we been there to offer them a story of hope,

653
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:17,800
a future, something that can bring us together,

654
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,240
rather than driving us apart?" Because I worry if that

655
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,360
is the future of this country, half of us on one side

656
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,160
of the road, half of us on the other, shouting names

657
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,640
at each other, responding to hatred with more hatred,

658
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,760
I wonder whether this could get worse and worse.

659
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,800
I think if the working people of this country

660
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,240
are divided, that's only going to benefit the rich

661
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,000
and ordinary families will get poorer and poorer.

662
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,080
But if we're united, we can win.

663
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,560
So this video is ultimately about the importance

664
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,320
of understanding how the media works,

665
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,600
salience, storytelling, how we win the future.

666
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,360
But I think more than that,

667
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,760
it's about whether we're able to view each other

668
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,280
as people and with compassion.

669
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,320
Because if you can do that,

670
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,600
then we can come together.

671
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,280
And if we can come together, we can win.

672
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,920
So that's the end.

673
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,400
Good luck.

674
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,280
Thank you.
