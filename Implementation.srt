1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Correct implementation on tax policy is a job of

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,800
experts and government and and civil service.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,600
It is not the job of ******* YouTubers.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,160
All right, so we'll do one on implementation

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,480
of wealth taxes and how to reduce inequality.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,840
And the reason we have to do that is

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,800
because we are, like, increasingly doing

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,520
really, really, really well on narrative.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,680
We are influencing what the media talk about.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,120
We're influencing the debate on this.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,200
Like, we have a massive presence in the debate now.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,240
Governments are failing, especially the government

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,200
here in the UK is really, really unpopular and they

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,000
will have to do something or they will

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,440
lose really badly in the next election.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,080
And increasingly we are looking like quite well-positioned

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,680
to be the way that they might have to turn.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,040
So they might come to us and we

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,080
might, we might get something.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,480
And what worries me is there is like a phenomenal

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,320
naivety at the moment in the way that people

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,800
are talking about wealth taxes, basically.

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,520
And basically that people seem to think that

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,640
the government can just turn around and say,

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
"Okay, let's do wealth taxes.

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,200
Let's tax the rich now and

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,480
things will be fixed." Right?

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,440
The truth is, and I've always said this,

29
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,920
I've never tried to hide this, actually

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,960
raising taxes on the rich is going to be really,

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,760
really hard for a variety of reasons, right?

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,320
One of the biggest reasons is obviously

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,920
they control a lot of the media narrative.

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,440
They can sell lot of scare stories.

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,040
"If you tax us, we'll leave." Or they

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,600
can do a lot of sort of personally

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,160
attacking of me as an individual.

38
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,640
But the truth is there are things they can

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,120
do and you need to deal with those things.

40
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,720
Like the truth is they can leave, right?

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,760
And I've always said, and I constantly believe,

42
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,320
you know, look at the Abramovich situation,

43
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,760
which shows like here's a rich man who tried to leave.

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,880
And we just said, "Okay, well you can leave, but if

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,480
you're going to own British assets, we can tax British

46
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,440
assets." And that's always been my comeback to that.

47
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,000
And that is true, but you need make sure

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,160
that you have your legal systems in place.

49
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,680
Like people sometimes ask me, you know,

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
"If you were Chancellor, what would you do?

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
If you were Prime Minister, what would you do?"

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
And I always turn around and say, "Listen, goddamn,

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,440
like, it's not that easy." The implementation

54
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,640
and the design... the correct implementation

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,200
and the correct design of this tax

56
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,280
or these taxes, it has to be so good.

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
It has be really, really good.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,600
And there's... I think, a sensible government

59
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,400
at this point would be calling me...

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,360
Like the sensible thing do is to call me up and

61
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,400
say, "All right, look, we get it, right?

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
We see..." Like the argument I'm making is correct.

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,680
Inequality is increasing really, really quickly.

64
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,880
The rich are rapidly increasing their wealth.

65
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,480
It's squeezing everybody out.

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,800
It's destroying the middle class.

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,080
It's destroying the government.

68
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,920
It's having and will continue to have like

69
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,720
really destructive effects on living standards.

70
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,920
You need to fix it.

71
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,520
Like 100% you need to fix it.

72
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,120
The only way to really do that is to

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,280
aggressively increase taxes on the rich.

74
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,960
The truth is that's ******* hard to do.

75
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
So they should be calling me up and

76
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,640
saying, "Listen, okay, we see it.

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
You, you know, you're right.

78
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,400
We understand now.

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,320
Okay, you don't deal with

80
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,000
inequality, you're kind of ****ed.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
But the rich are saying they're going to leave.

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,160
We don't really... We don't

83
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
think it's possible." You know what I mean?

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,440
So then you call me up and you say,

85
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,000
"Okay, all right, let's put the *******

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
work in." We put the ******* work in.

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,040
We design this tax so that it's ******* good.

88
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,000
So it's watertight.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,560
You know, you look at things like what China

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,600
does. China doesn't allow you to own a

91
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,080
**** ton of Chinese wealth and live overseas.

92
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,600
You ask the question, you realistically discuss

93
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,120
the question, how much can the UK do by itself?

94
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
Or realistically, do we need international corporation?

95
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,200
International corporation is achievable.

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
If you look at when we last significantly reduced

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,760
inequality, it was in the aftermath of World

98
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
War II, and it was done internationally.

99
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,520
Everybody did it together and it worked.

100
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,560
The truth is, this would be difficult

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,880
for the UK, specifically the UK.

102
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,000
I think a massive country like the US

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,840
would probably have an easier time, especially

104
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
when you consider how many of the billionaires

105
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
and the massive companies are based in the US.

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
I think the US would have an

107
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
easier time to do it by itself.

108
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,360
I think a country like the UK could do some things

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,320
by themselves, but like why do it by yourself?

110
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,480
This problem is happening everywhere.

111
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,240
We have a mass opportunity to

112
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,560
build something internationally here.

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
But there's this like real childish naivety,

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
which is like, okay, fine, just give it like...

115
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,800
The big thing that you see, and this I

116
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,480
think really encapsulates the childish naivety

117
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,200
that I talk about, is people turn around me

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,680
and they say, "Okay, I'll show... all right.

119
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,400
Show me the tax policy then.

120
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,200
Show me the tax policy." You know,

121
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,080
listen, I'm here in my kitchen, right?

122
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,520
Which is real, like with a

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,640
massive ******* YouTube channel.

124
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,960
Like, I'm pretty much, pretty obviously

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,400
the world's biggest campaigner for wealth

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
taxes and I work ******* hard, right?

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,160
Do you think tax policies are

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,640
usually made by YouTubers?

129
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,080
Like, tax policy is not you give... We

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
spoke about this in the tariffs video, right?

131
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,040
Which is that the Trump tariffs had

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,920
this similar vibe, which is like some

133
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,800
random intern, like, bashed it together.

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,640
Oh, Cambodia.

135
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,880
Yeah, **** Cambodia.

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,480
You know what I mean?

137
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,280
Like, what is this idiocracy behavior?

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,560
Listen, if you want good tax policy, you need

139
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,720
to pay good ******* tax people and you need to

140
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,880
sit them in a room for a long ******* time and

141
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,520
you need to make sure they design that policy.

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
Even if I was the ******* smartest guy in the

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,480
world, you wouldn't want one ******* guy to design...

144
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,280
This is not *******... Do you remember that Little

145
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,000
Britain, write the theme tune, sing the theme tune?

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,280
It's like, you know, like,

147
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,720
alright, you, oh, you're the campaigner.

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
You ******* make it yourself then.

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,920
What have we become as a country. Like, listen,

150
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,880
if you want good tax policy, you need to pay proper

151
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
tax experts for their expertise and their time.

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,640
And you spend... Listen, you spend two years

153
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,240
designing the tax policy, obviously.

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
Obviously.

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,720
It's idiotic this approach.

156
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,040
Listen, I would be more than happy, more than

157
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,680
******* happy to be involved in making sure

158
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
this tax policy is designed well, obviously.

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,120
But the way that you do that is you get the tax

160
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
experts, you talk to me, you talk to the other

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,080
guys, you build a team of proper good tax experts.

162
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,880
You think about the question of how do we

163
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
deal with people who leave the country?

164
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,760
Can we still tax them on the UK assets like,

165
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,240
like we did to Abramovich, like China does?

166
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,320
You look at how these issues

167
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,280
were dealt with in the past.

168
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,360
You look at how wealth inequality was reduced

169
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,600
significantly in the 20th century. You

170
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,640
have sensible discussions, but I'm constantly faced

171
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,880
with these like idiotically simplistic discussions

172
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
which are totally bad faith, which is like, "Oh, okay.

173
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,680
You've recognised that the ship's going to sink.

174
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Well, why don't you ******* fix the hole your

175
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,000
******* self then, you ******* idiot?" It's

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
unbelievably childish and it's unbelievably chaotic.

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,480
Like, listen, we're supposed to be

178
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,360
adult, grownup, mature countries here.

179
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,520
I have correctly identified a massive problem

180
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,240
in our economy that is going to devastate

181
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,400
living standards if nothing is done about it.

182
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,320
You need to fix that with well-designed tax policy and

183
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,000
well-designed tax policy takes experts and it takes

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,720
money and it takes resources and it takes hard work.

185
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,320
So and that is the message.

186
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,680
You know, that is the message.

187
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,880
So listen, we're winning the debate and

188
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,000
it's not just because of me, but that's because

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
I've been focused on winning the ******* debate.

190
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,280
Okay.

191
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,600
Implementation is going to be hard.

192
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,480
You know, and I emailed... Just this week I emailed

193
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Gabriel Zucman, who is French economist who

194
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,360
I've got a lot of time and a lot of respect for,

195
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,520
he's working on similar things.

196
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,320
And I said to him, "Listen, dear Gabriel,

197
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,640
we're winning the debate here.

198
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Who have we got working on

199
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,960
implementation?" You know what I mean?

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,400
Because listen, I can't do

201
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,040
******* everything by myself.

202
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,160
You know what I mean?

203
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,840
Correct implementation on tax policy is a job of

204
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,240
experts and government and civil service.

205
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,280
It is not the job of *******

206
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
YouTubers, you know what I mean?

207
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,720
And we need to win the debate and

208
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
we need to win implementation.

209
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,480
And, you know, I want to be clear, right?

210
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,520
I know I've campaigned for 2%

211
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,960
on wealth of above 10 million, you know.

212
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,040
That's what I do.

213
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,200
That's what Patriotic Millionaires do.

214
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
That would be good.

215
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,760
But like, this is not like I've sat

216
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
down and picked the perfect tax policy.

217
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,920
And people sometimes criticise me like,

218
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,720
"Oh, that form of wealth tax is not good.

219
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,160
We need another form of wealth tax." I'm here for that.

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,880
Let's have those discussions,

221
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,520
let's build a tax policy, you know?

222
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,800
But this kind of really stupid shutting

223
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
down of the debate is, "Oh, you've correctly

224
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,000
identified that our economy's going to be devastated.

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
Well, why don't you fix it?"

226
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,600
We need to grow up basically.

227
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,280
We need to grow up.

228
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,040
But, you know, the reason I'm here and I've

229
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,680
finally done a video on implementation is because

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,720
we're winning the debate and I'm really proud of,

231
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,240
of myself and so should you be, the work you've put

232
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,840
on it and so should everybody watching, because

233
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,680
this... What I think is really interesting

234
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,920
about like our, like, increasing narrative

235
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,840
victory here is people go on TV, so like when

236
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,760
like... It's Neil Kinnock is his name, right?

237
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,280
Is it Neil?

238
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,440
When he went on TV recently and he was like, "2%

239
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,520
wealth tax above 10 million." That is exactly

240
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,760
the wealth tax that I campaigned for, but

241
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,920
he didn't say Gary Stevenson wealth tax.

242
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,160
And he probably didn't hear it from me, right?

243
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,640
Like, and we don't have a massive

244
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,840
presence in the mainstream media.

245
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,080
Like, the way that we do this is we feed it into

246
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,840
the public and it comes up from the public to

247
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,960
the newspapers and to the politicians and, like,

248
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,960
it's... I think this is, I think

249
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,600
it's kind of inspiring to show how much power

250
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,080
the public has if they stick to a message, right?

251
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,680
And if they're very clear on it.

252
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,640
It shows that, like, you know,

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,520
a YouTuber, you know, it's not just me, you know.

254
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,200
I mentioned before, Patriotic Millionaires and

255
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
all these other guys who do their good work.

256
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,160
We can drive it up.

257
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
We can drive it up through the people.

258
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,600
But then, you know, if politicians

259
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,680
turn around and say, "Oh, okay, great.

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,560
Let's just..." You know.

261
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,680
We're not going to provide the policy, you know.

262
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,840
And we were speaking this week about, you know,

263
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,040
maybe we could try and get some funding to get

264
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,160
some tax le-... I'll be honest with you,

265
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm ******* busy here, you know what I mean?

266
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,160
And it's stressful and I'm doing a lot of work and

267
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,440
I'm really focused on narrative and I think the

268
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,280
work that we do here is really, really, really vital.

269
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,760
So we were thinking about like getting some experts in

270
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,120
to fund tax... to actually work on implementation

271
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,600
and trying to get some money for that.

272
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,320
But the truth is, the honest

273
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,800
truth is, it shouldn't be our job.

274
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
It shouldn't be our job and I know like, you

275
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,920
know, I do lot of jobs that shouldn't be my job,

276
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,520
but, I would like to do a shout-out to like

277
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,840
governments, not just here in the UK, right?

278
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,920
Because this is an international problem.

279
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,800
Governments and, real governments that

280
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,600
want fix their ******* problems, you need to work...

281
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,480
you need to fund the policy on tax work on this.

282
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,040
Civil services across the country,

283
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,640
including this country, think tanks.

284
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,720
Listen, I'm working my tits off out here.

285
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,840
Get your best people working on how we do this.

286
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,120
And, you know, I would love to help and,

287
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
if the UK Government was to

288
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
call me, I'd definitely make time for it.

289
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
This is not ******* Gary Stevenson

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,040
saves the world, you know?

291
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,640
We need other people helping to design this.

292
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm 100% aware and I've always been aware, effectively

293
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,400
implementing tax on the richest people will be hard.

294
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,360
I've never ever, ever said anything else and I know it

295
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,200
was hard and I knew from the start it would be hard.

296
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
And I, if I'm honest, I never thought

297
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
we'd get as far as we have already come.

298
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,960
But I don't do this because it's easy.

299
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,520
I do this because it's essential.

300
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,880
This is as simple as that.

301
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,800
It's as simple as that.

302
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
If you don't want your country to collapse

303
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,760
into poverty, you have to deal with this.

304
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,960
We've got the people, we've got the experts,

305
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,880
get them in a ******* room together, pay them

306
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,400
what they need and get that tax policy *******

307
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,360
sorted and give it the time it needs.

308
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,840
And I would like to see, you know,

309
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,360
this is not a UK specific problem.

310
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,960
I want to see politicians and economists

311
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,440
and civil servants in Germany, in Italy, in

312
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,880
Spain, in France, in Japan, in Australia.

313
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,160
I would say America, but we're not likely get them.

314
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,520
Oh, and Canada, because they always

315
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,680
complain that I don't mention them.

316
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,040
And New Zealand, get a lot of those.

317
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,480
Listen, what I'm looking for is like

318
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,040
ruthless practicality and pragmatism.

319
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,320
How do we effectively get wealth back

320
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,560
from the very rich, or at the very least

321
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,360
stop, them from taking more of our wealth?

322
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
Which has an understanding of the fact

323
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,920
that a lot of those rich are domestic,

324
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,680
but a lot of those rich are also overseas.

325
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,720
And how does... And they, they're

326
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
immobile, and how do we deal with that?

327
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,320
That is thing that can be dealt with.

328
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,040
It's been dealt with in the

329
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
past, it can be dealt with again.

330
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,600
And I will always say when people say it's

331
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,720
not possible, it was done in the 20th century.

332
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,040
It was done in the 20th century, inequality was reduced

333
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,840
massively and we should look at how they did that.

334
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,800
JACK: On international corporation,

335
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
there is a minimum corporation tax now that was...

336
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,960
Yeah, I mean, and that's Gabriel Zucman.

337
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,520
I'm pretty sure that's Gabriel

338
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,680
Zucman, and, and... You know, I'm

339
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,480
not the only guy out here, you know.

340
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,040
I'm very visible, I've chosen the YouTube

341
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,640
strategy, but, you know, I mentioned Rebecca

342
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,960
Gowland and Patriotic Millionaires, Gabriel Zucman,

343
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,160
Thomas Pierki, Aaron Advani, and there'll be

344
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,480
1,000 other guys across the world doing this work.

345
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,800
All of you boffins out there, tax experts,

346
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
economists, start building these policies.

347
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,640
Start building these policies.

348
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,800
Once we've won this debate and I stop

349
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,680
having to ******* argue it again and again,

350
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,760
I'll come out there and I'll help you

351
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,840
build the policy, but I can't do it myself.

352
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,520
Implementation will be hard, you have to do it.

353
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,360
I'll keep making the videos.

354
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,440
Let's get you boffins to start making the policies.

355
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,000
Listen, we got four years in this

356
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,760
country before the next election.

357
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,960
Labour, you've got four years, but it's going to

358
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,160
take... it's going to take two or three to get this right.

359
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,600
So, start moving.

360
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
Thank you very much.

361
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Tax wealth not work.

362
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Send it your friends, send it to your mum.

363
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,400
I'm done for the day.
