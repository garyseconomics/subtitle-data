1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,640
Okay.

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,240
Welcome back to today's special bonus

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,920
edition of Gary's Economics,

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,720
where we are going to talk about truth, lies and games.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,600
Okay, so today is the 30th of January,

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,960
which means it is the release

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,880
of the paperback of my book,

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
this, new paperback version. It's much cheaper.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
I think it's about £10, something like that.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,040
And to commemorate the release of the paperback,

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,080
I wanted to do an edition

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,680
where I speak about a story

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,840
that happened to me when I was a trader,

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
which I write about in the book,

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,000
which really helped me to understand, in my mind,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,320
Donald Trump during the last Donald Trump presidency.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,040
So obviously Donald Trump is back.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,000
And I wanted to share a story

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,120
from the book which helped me

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,800
think about it, deal with it, and understand it.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,880
Okay, so towards the end of my time at Citibank,

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,120
I decided I wanted to leave.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,200
And, the opening scene of my book is,

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,760
my boss at the time, basically, pretty strongly

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,920
threatening me that,

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
I could get in quite a lot of trouble

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
if I tried to leave the bank.

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,720
That led to the beginning

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,680
of kind of a crazy period in my life

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,760
where I was quite frequently

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
threatened by senior management at Citibank.

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,800
And I entered this period at work,

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
which I call the meeting period,

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,440
which was where

35
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,160
for about 3 or 4 weeks,

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,280
every single day,

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,280
I would have 2 or 3 or 4 meetings

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,640
with senior management at Citibank.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,840
And at the time I was living in Tokyo,

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
working in Tokyo, in Japan.

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
And Citibank is obviously

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,440
a massive, massive, massive organisation.

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,720
And there's all these different members

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,560
of senior management.

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,960
And every meeting

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
would have like, a different combination

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,120
of bank senior managers in the meeting.

48
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,120
So one day might be a one-on-one

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,920
with a specific manager in Tokyo.

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,400
And then the next meeting might be four guys,

51
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
one in New York, one in London,

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,080
one in Tokyo, one in Singapore.

53
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,880
Then there might be a big zoom call with like ten guys.

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,560
And each one of these meetings...

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,000
what was interesting about these meetings was

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
each one of these meetings,

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,480
the management would have basically

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,080
a different kind of strategy

59
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,280
of what we're going to do in this meeting.

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
So you might, for example,

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
have a good cop, bad cop meeting.

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
So for those who don't know,

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
you're meeting with two guys

64
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,840
and one of them just like shouts in your face.

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
And then he takes breaks and the other guy

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
says, listen,

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,480
I want to help you, I want to be on your side,

68
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,160
I want to deal with this.

69
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,600
But then you might have another meeting

70
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,480
where you just have

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,920
6, 7 top senior management,

72
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,520
and beforehand they've decided with each other,

73
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,160
what we're going to do

74
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
is we're just going to be really,

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
really supportive to Gary.

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,640
We're going to tell him we're behind him.

77
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,440
So you would have this like

78
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,600
really weird combination

79
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,040
of, you go into to one meeting

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,640
and a guy would, like, scream in your face for an hour

81
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,600
and you go into the next meeting.

82
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,560
Sometimes these meetings

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,160
could be like even directly back

84
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,200
to back in the same kind of like zoom office room.

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,920
And everyone would be like,

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
we love you, we support you.

87
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,160
And, sometimes you would get this amazing situation

88
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,920
where the same guy

89
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,200
who had just been shouting you for an hour

90
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,640
was also scheduled to be in the next meeting,

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,520
which was immediately afterwards.

92
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,560
So you'd have a guy stop shouting at you,

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
sit down,

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,280
turn on this like zoom call on the big screen.

95
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,440
And one by one, everyone, including him, would say,

96
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,560
we believe in you, you know, we’re really behind you,

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,600
we really support you.

98
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,080
And,

99
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,800
you know, when I told Jack about this earlier,

100
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,080
he said, oh it must have made you go mad.

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,600
But actually, these little weird features

102
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,200
were kind of what kept me sane in the period

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,520
because they were so funny.

104
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,760
It was so funny to see this guy

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,240
immediately switch from being like,

106
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,480
like a crazy animal,

107
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,240
just shouting at you

108
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,200
to being like a kind of cuddly teddy bear.

109
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,880
Just because he's turned a zoom call on

110
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,920
and it's a different meeting.

111
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,760
And what this made me realise,

112
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,720
and it wasn't just this,

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
it was a lot of things when I was working at Citibank,

114
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,000
is that

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,440
rich and powerful people

116
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,160
have quite a different attitude and approach to truth

117
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,160
and lies and games compared to ordinary people.

118
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,920
So I think most ordinary people,

119
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,040
when they are having a conversation with somebody,

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,640
there is a kind of assumption

121
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,960
that if you say something, it is because you

122
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,000
believe it,

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
and it is because you think it,

124
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,960
it is because you feel it.

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,760
That is why you say things.

126
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,800
And there's a kind of assumption

127
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,640
that people say things because they're true

128
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,360
or it's what they think.

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
But a lot of rich people and a lot of powerful people,

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,680
they don't

131
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,080
approach their conversations in this way,

132
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,720
especially if it is conversations

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,800
which have any relationship

134
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,840
with money or power or their work.

135
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,080
They will often go into

136
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
a conversation with a kind of a game playing mentality,

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,600
which is what is our objective from this conversation?

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
What is our objective from this meeting?

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,480
So in the case of the story in my book,

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,360
they didn't want me to quit.

141
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,720
So it's like,

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
what is our strategy

143
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,000
to stop Gary from quitting basically.

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
And then you'll go in basically

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,280
playing a character and trying to think, what is the...

146
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,560
what do I need to say

147
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,320
in order to get the things that I want?

148
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
What is the optimal choice of words, choice of strategy

149
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,240
to try and get the outcome that I want?

150
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,480
And because I spent a lot of time at Citibank,

151
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,360
working with very rich, very powerful people,

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,320
you start to realise that this is a very normal way

153
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,560
of interacting,

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
of human interactions

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
in this world of rich and powerful people.

156
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
And for that reason,

157
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,800
when Donald Trump came into power,

158
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,600
I was not really surprised at all

159
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,840
by the way,

160
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,120
the things that he said and the way that he behaved.

161
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
So Donald Trump

162
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,880
and of course, you've also got Elon Musk

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,480
now in this new administration.

164
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,760
They both tend to do this thing

165
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,440
of saying an awful lot of things.

166
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,480
They say, we're going to do this.

167
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,240
They say we're going to do that.

168
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
And sometimes the things that they say seem crazy.

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,320
And you get people in the media saying,

170
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,400
oh my God, if they do that policy,

171
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,440
how is it going to affect us?

172
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,080
What's it going to do?

173
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,120
And then what you would often

174
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,720
find in the last administration is

175
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,280
he would say, we're going to do this thing.

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,120
And then nothing would come of it.

177
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,800
There would never be any actual policy

178
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,160
or ever even any attempt at a policy. And this

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,080
confused people because a lot of people assumed

180
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,880
that if somebody like Donald Trump says,

181
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,000
I want to do this thing, or I'm going to do this thing

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,280
that means that he wants to do this thing,

183
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,680
or he's going to do that thing.

184
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,240
But from somebody who's

185
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,000
been in these meetings

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,360
and seen how people basically say

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,240
whatever they think works in that specific meeting,

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,280
I was not surprised at all, really.

189
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,200
This is a very, very common way

190
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,840
of rich and powerful people behaving.

191
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,160
So what that means is we shouldn't really read anything

192
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,080
in terms of what rich or powerful people

193
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
actually say, or actually want,

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,360
or actually are going to do from what they say

195
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
they want, or what they say they're going to do.

196
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,720
When people...

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,760
when rich and powerful people say something

198
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,920
really more than anything,

199
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,320
it tells us something about what

200
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,440
they want us to believe.

201
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,680
And this also explains often why

202
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
what people say is so at odds with what they do.

203
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,360
For example,

204
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,000
you've got the Conservatives

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
who continually said

206
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,560
they were anti-migration and yet enormously increased

207
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,640
the number of legal migration into the country.

208
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,840
You have Elon Musk,

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,880
who again, is trying to fund anti-immigration parties

210
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,320
and yet is trying to increase

211
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,560
immigration of many kinds into the US.

212
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
When these rich and powerful people speak,

213
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,480
we should always be asking us

214
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
fundamentally, at the very heart,

215
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,560
what do these people want?

216
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,840
And in the vast majority of cases,

217
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
what rich and powerful people want

218
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,880
is more wealth, more power,

219
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,280
not just for them, but also for their kids.

220
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,480
So a few years ago,

221
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,480
when Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine,

222
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,520
I won't lie, I was surprised.

223
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm not a Putin expert,

224
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,080
and I was surprised he did that

225
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,120
because I thought immediately,

226
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,800
he's already super rich, he's already super powerful,

227
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
that jeopardises

228
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,920
his situation, it jeopardises his future.

229
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,560
Why would he do that?

230
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,480
And the first thing I did was

231
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,000
I went onto Wikipedia, I looked up Vladimir Putin.

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,360
I wanted to know how old he was.

233
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,600
Does he have any kids? Does he have any sons?

234
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,920
And that is because I understand that most

235
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,840
elderly, wealthy, powerful

236
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,880
men are primarily concerned

237
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
with successfully transferring their wealth

238
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,760
and their power to their kids

239
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,240
and in many cases,

240
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,840
they're focused on getting it to their sons

241
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,720
or one particular son.

242
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
And I think this is

243
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,200
the way that you can primarily understand

244
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,120
people like Musk, people like Putin, people like Trump.

245
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,840
You need to understand their motivations.

246
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,400
What do they want? What do they want?

247
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,280
What do they want?

248
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,480
And of course, everyone is an individual

249
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,560
and people want different things

250
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,640
and you can't perfectly know what Putin wants.

251
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
We can't perfectly know what Trump wants.

252
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
We can't perfectly know what Musk wants.

253
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,480
But most of the time

254
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,200
it is about amassing further wealth and power

255
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,120
for themselves, for their kids.

256
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
You know, they always say in football,

257
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,080
you know, don’t watch the man

258
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,880
watch the ball

259
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,640
because he's going to throw all kinds of feints.

260
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,280
Pretend he's going to be this way,

261
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
pretend he's going to go that way.

262
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,200
Ultimately, he wants to get the ball into the goal

263
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,560
and most of the time, getting the ball into the goal

264
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,640
means getting more money, getting more wealth.

265
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
And I wanted to say like, this is not...

266
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,600
if you want to understand,

267
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
I spoke to a friend about this

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,440
and he said, you know, I can't really understand

269
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
this way of being, where you’ll basically say anything

270
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
if you think is going to get you what you want,

271
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,320
because most people don't do that.

272
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,120
But the truth is,

273
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
when you are in a game situation, this often happens.

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
I was around a friend's house

275
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
playing Catan a couple of months ago.

276
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
Good friends house, I’m good friends

277
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,120
with both her and her husband.

278
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,720
And her husband was trying to do this trade with me.

279
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,480
And he said, look, I'll trade this with you.

280
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,240
And I said, no.

281
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
And he said, listen, I've got this card.

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,160
If I use this card, I'm

283
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,920
going to take that resource anyway.

284
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,600
So whether you do the trade

285
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,080
or I'm going to take it anyway.

286
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,440
So I did the trade with him

287
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,520
and it later transpired

288
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,200
he didn't even have the card that he said he had.

289
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,480
And I was kind of shocked,

290
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,680
basically because it was a lie

291
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,560
and I was sort of like, wow, I can't believe you lied.

292
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,760
And he said, look, it's a game.

293
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,320
You know, I'm trying to win the game.

294
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,240
You know, that's... 

295
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,480
that’s the way that it is.

296
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,280
And I'm reminded also of a friend of mine

297
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
when we were teenagers,

298
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,040
I used to play a lot of Monopoly,

299
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,120
and I played with my high school friends.

300
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,720
And I think the first three games

301
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,160
I won, I was quite good at monopoly,

302
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,560
which is quite a big deal because it’s

303
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,080
a 5/6 player game.

304
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,440
And then one of my friends decided that the way to win

305
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,960
Monopoly is to specifically stop Gary from winning.

306
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,160
And he would attack all of...

307
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
every time I tried to trade with someone,

308
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,240
he would just attack that other person,

309
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,760
like brutally insult the other person.

310
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
And I would ask him afterwards, like, why, why,

311
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,400
why are you telling everyone these deals are bad?

312
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,440
You know they're not bad deals.

313
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,600
But he would genuinely believe in his heart

314
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,160
that they were bad deals.

315
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
And I would start doing a thing where

316
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,880
if he attacked a deal,

317
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,920
I would start saying to the person

318
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,320
I was trying to trade with, okay,

319
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,360
if you think that's a bad deal,

320
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,120
let's completely flip the deal.

321
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,680
I will take everything you were going to have,

322
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,400
and you can have everything I was going to have.

323
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
And this friend of mine would immediately

324
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,960
switch on an instant

325
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,240
into attacking the other side of the deal,

326
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,520
and he didn't think it was at all consistent

327
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,760
to attack both sides of the deal.

328
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,040
Whichever side of the deal I was on.

329
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,920
I think what this shows is

330
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,720
when people really, really want something,

331
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,360
they will

332
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
basically believe

333
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,520
whatever they need to believe in that moment

334
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,760
and say whatever they need to say in that moment

335
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,000
to get that thing.

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,680
So don't expect consistency.

337
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,120
Don't expect consistent ideology.

338
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,840
Don't expect consistent beliefs.

339
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,160
What you should expect

340
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,720
consistently is a consistent drive

341
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,240
to accumulate wealth and power.

342
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,800
And what I want you to do when that happens

343
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,960
is to not get sucked in to the games

344
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,920
that are being played.

345
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
Lots of words are going to be thrown around.

346
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Lots of stories are going to be thrown around,

347
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
lots of ideas are going to be thrown around,

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
which are generally going to

349
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,280
be designed to destabilise you

350
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,560
and make you weak

351
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,680
so that your wealth

352
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
and your resources can be transferred

353
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,280
to the powerful over time.

354
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Don't get sucked into the game.

355
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,800
I think if you can be dragged

356
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,640
into a game playing mentality,

357
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,760
we can end up in a situation where it's a straight

358
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,240
shoot out in a game between the powerful and the weak,

359
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,360
and unless you're a multi-millionaire,

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,960
you are one of the weak.

361
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,000
The way you win this game is to not play the game.

362
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,360
Step outside the rules of the game, and realise

363
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,840
you need to ally with other poor

364
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,840
and ordinary people because if you don't,

365
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,400
the rich will win the game,

366
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,720
they will take your resources.

367
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,000
And ultimately,

368
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,080
in a crazy way,

369
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,320
I think that's how I won my battle with Citibank.

370
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,440
I went a little bit crazy.

371
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,320
I broke a few of the rules, I stepped outside the game,

372
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
and I never got sued, and I never went to prison.

373
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,960
I never got bankrupted.

374
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,400
And that is why I was able to write this book.

375
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,280
It's out today.

376
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,520
I'm very proud of it. It's called the Trading Game.

377
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,520
I wanted to talk about truth, lies and games

378
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,000
because for me, a big part of the story is about

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,040
how I got sucked into a game,

380
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,720
how young people get sucked into a game,

381
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,200
and how when you get sucked into a game,

382
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,560
an obsession with the game

383
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,720
can basically kind of kill your humanity inside.

384
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,040
And it's that journey for me.

385
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't want it to happen to you.

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,120
I don't want to happen to us.

387
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,160
Listen,

388
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,880
the next few years are going to be a difficult time.

389
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,120
And they're going to be difficult

390
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,520
for your mental health,

391
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,400
and they're going to be difficult for society.

392
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,160
And they're going to be difficult

393
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,120
economically as well.

394
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,920
I think the most important thing

395
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,920
is that you try to stay mentally healthy.

396
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,560
And that means talking to each other,

397
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,960
trying your best to be compassionate

398
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,880
and understanding of each other. Very rich and very...

399
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,640
very rich

400
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,520
and very powerful people

401
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,600
are going to be trying to drive us apart

402
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,960
and to make us unstable and to make us angry

403
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,200
and to make us hate each other.

404
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,320
There's a great section in a great book about this.

405
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
I think it's the two minutes hate

406
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
or the three minutes hate in 1984 by George Orwell,

407
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,600
but he's basically talking about how

408
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
if the powerful can convince the poor to hate,

409
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
not even anything specific, but just hate in general,

410
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,760
then it's very easy to control them.

411
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,440
Because people who hate are not people who can unite.

412
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
And who of you can't unite,

413
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,560
are not able to be powerful.

414
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,600
Stay strong, speak to each other.

415
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,920


416
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,040
I'll finish by just saying

417
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
thank you to everyone who supported us

418
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,800
so much since the comeback.

419
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,400
The views have been just crazy.

420
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
And the amount of attention has been crazy.

421
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,520
But I'm really appreciative.

422
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
And I will try my best

423
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,160
to build something that can help us,

424
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
but you need to build things to,

425
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
be there for each other.

426
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Thank you for support.

427
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,920
Thank you

428
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,880
especially for everyone who signed up for the Patreon.

429
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,960
We really appreciate that.

430
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
If you can buy the book, it's a very good book,

431
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
but if you can't,

432
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,920
then just support us

433
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,200
and then help us to drive forward

434
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,720
and help us try to make things better.

435
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,520
Thank you. Good luck.
