00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,760
Welcome back to Gary's economics.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,640
Today, we're going to explain why

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,720
rent, profits and interest are all the same thing.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,520
So I wanted to bring it back to basics

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,400
and do a nice educational video

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,440
that is going to help you to understand

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,680
the way the economy works.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,880
Now, I've always considered rent,

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,840
profits and interest

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,200
to be basically transformations of the same thing,

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,840
but I don't think many people think of them in that way.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,560
So I want to explain why I think this

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,640
I think is going to help you explain

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,160
basically the structure of our economy.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,960
Now, the first thing to say is

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,640
the title is not to be taken exactly, literally, of course.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,200
There are important differences

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,720
between rent, profits and interests.

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,320
And we're going to explain them

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,840
in more detail in this video.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,320
But in a very real important sense,

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,400
these three things are all the same thing.

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,040
And the way they can basically be described

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,680
is all three, rent, profits and interests

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
are payments

26
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,080
that are made by poorer people, the non owners of assets,

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,480
to richer people,

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,320
the owners of assets in order to use those assets.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,960
And I think the best way to explain

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,920
how that works is to go through an example.

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,200
So let's say I've got half a million pounds

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,080
and you are a person who has nowhere to live

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,640
and you need somewhere to live.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,360
So you come to me

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,000
and you say, alright

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
Gary, I've got nowhere to live,

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
you've got a half million pounds,

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
can you help me to get a house to live in?

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,520
We can do this

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,200
and we can structure this in three different ways.

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
So number one, the most obvious way, is

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,720
I use that half million pounds to buy a house,

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,440
I rent that house to you.

44
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,040
This is the classic landlord tenant relationship.

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,200
I buy the house.

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,160
I rent it to you. You pay me £25,000 a year rent.

47
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,800
Number one,

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
rents.

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
The second way we can do is I lend you the money.

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
I lend you the half million pounds.

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
You buy the house

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
and then you pay me

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,800
£25,000 interest every year, in order to live in the house.

54
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,760
So now you're paying £25,000, the same amount,

55
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,600
but in interest.

56
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560
And the third way

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,880
that we construct this is, I set up a company,

58
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,800
I use the company to buy a house.

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,320
You live in the house.

60
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,920
You pay £25,000 a year rent to the company.

61
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
That company makes £25,000

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,160
a year profits, and it pays it to me in dividends.

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,840
So in all three of these cases,

64
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,560
I use my half million pounds to buy a house.

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm allowing you to live in that house

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,880
and you are paying me £25,000 a year to live in the house.

67
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,360
But in situation one, I receive rent.

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,760
In situation number two, I receive interest.

69
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
And in situation number three,

70
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,360
I receive dividends from profits.

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,720
So you see from the perspective of me

72
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,360
as a wealthy person, as an investor,

73
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
once I have a certain amount of wealth,

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
I can buy, in this case,

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,120
the exact same asset, the exact same house

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,760
in three different ways.

77
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,480
And the financial structure

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,520
I choose around that purchase

79
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
basically determines

80
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,480
whether I receive rent, interest or dividends.

81
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,000
So for me as an investor, they're basically the same thing.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
I have half a million pounds.

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,440
I want to receive some sort of passive income stream

84
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,440
and I can choose what to do. And for me

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,280
it's really easy to transfer between the two.

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,760
So let's say I chose the third option

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,080
and I bought the house in a company.

88
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,280
Eventually, I’m thinking, okay,

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,520
the structure of a company is not working for me.

90
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm going to collapse the company.

91
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm going to take direct ownership of the property.

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,280
Now I'm receiving rent directly,

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,520
so I don't want to receive rent anymore.

94
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
I want to start receiving interests.

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, well, I sell the house.

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
I'll buy government bonds.

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Now I'm receiving interest from the government.

98
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
I can sell those government bonds

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,200
and I can buy mortgage bonds.

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,160
Now I'm receiving, again

101
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,320
your mortgage interest payments for the house.

102
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,640
That's not working for me. I sell it.

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,600
I buy the stock market.

104
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,480
Now I'm receiving company profits.

105
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,720
So from the perspective of the individual, it's

106
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,600
super easy to transfer between these things.

107
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,920
And I think,

108
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,440
I think ordinary people don't tend to realise that.

109
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,960
Basically, once you are a wealthy person,

110
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,440
you own a certain amount of assets.

111
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,280
Even by buying just the same asset,

112
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,440
you can choose to receive rent, interest, dividends,

113
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,480
which is profit. They're basically the same thing.

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,280
And in all three cases

115
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
that cash flow,

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,800
you know, many people describe these cash

117
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,440
flows on the internet as passive income.

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,200
In all three cases, it's not really passive income.

119
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,760
It's money that comes from you.

120
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,000
I own the house,

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,640
you live in the house and you're paying me your salary

122
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,160
to live in the house.

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
And this is basically what all of these things are.

124
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,240
These are payments made by you.

125
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,360
A poorer person who does not have assets

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
to me, a rich person who has assets

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
in order to use those assets.

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,440
And it goes a lot beyond housing.

129
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,680
Let's say you book a flight, you go to Portugal with EasyJet,

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
you go to the barber, let's take the flight situation.

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
You need a plane.

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,040
So as a very wealthy person,

133
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,560
I could own a plane and I could rent it to EasyJet.

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
And part of your ticket

135
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,640
will go towards that rental of the plane, which goes to me.

136
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Or I could buy EasyJet stock. Part of your

137
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,280
ticket price goes towards EasyJet profits,

138
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,400
which comes to me.

139
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,280
Or I can lend money to EasyJet,

140
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,320
in which case part of your ticket

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,600
goes to interest payments again, to me.

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
So once again,

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,680
when you buy this ticket,

144
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
some of that money is going to me

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,800
as the owner of the assets.

146
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
If you go to the barber,

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
somebody owns that barber shop

148
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,640
and it could be that the barber is paying

149
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,600
rent to the owner of the property,

150
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,360
or it could be that the owner has taken a loan

151
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,160
to buy that property to pay interest to use the property.

152
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,280
Or it could be that

153
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,000
that barber is part

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,040
of a big barber corporation

155
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,360
and all of those properties are owned by the shareholders

156
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
and they receive the profits.

157
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,720
So in both cases, whether you’re taking a plane,

158
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,080
living in a house,

159
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,480
going to get your haircut,

160
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,320
you are paying some amount of money

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,280
to the owners of the physical assets that are being used.

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,240
The owners receive that in either profits, interest

163
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,720
or rent directly.

164
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,080
And you know,

165
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,760
this is even the case with the other

166
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
basic essentials that you need.

167
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,360
You know,

168
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,320
when you buy food, a big chunk of that goes

169
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,520
towards the owners of the farmland.

170
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,480
And again, that can take any one of these forms.

171
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,080
When you use energy to heat your home,

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,040
a big part of that money goes towards the owners

173
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,680
of the energy production infrastructure in our country.

174
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
Now, I want to talk a little bit about

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,200
a couple of big exceptions,

176
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,560
because I know there's going to be people

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,080
out there that say, listen,

178
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,480
if I buy a property

179
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,240
with a mortgage that's totally different from renting,

180
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
renting is money down the drain.

181
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
If I buy a house with a mortgage,

182
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,120
I can pay the mortgage off over time, I'm building up

183
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,440
equity in my house over time.

184
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,200
These two things are totally different,

185
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,880
and from one perspective, that is totally true.

186
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,960
If you as an individual rent a house,

187
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,480
you are not the legal owner of the house.

188
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,680
But if you take a mortgage and buy the house,

189
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,000
you are the legal owner of the house.

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,200
But let's go back to my example, right.

191
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,360
You know,

192
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
let's assume I've used half a million pounds to

193
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,880
buy a property, rent it to my sister.

194
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,320
She pays £25,000 a year rent.

195
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,240
If I lend £500,000 to my sister,

196
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,840
she buys the property, she pays £25,000 interest.

197
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,440
Now, assuming

198
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,320
she doesn't make any extra payments above the interest

199
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,880
in both cases, financially

200
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,520
her situation is exactly the same, basically.

201
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,400
She pays £25,000 a year rent

202
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,600
or she pays £25,000 a year interest.

203
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,960
So financially

204
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,680
there's no difference between these two things.

205
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
But there is one

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,640
very big important technical difference between buying with

207
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,480
a mortgage and renting,

208
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,640
which is who bears

209
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,680
the risk of changes in the price, changes in the value.

210
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,880
And I think this is the reason why people in this country

211
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,480
are so keen on buying with mortgages.

212
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,760
So if you rent and the price of the property goes up,

213
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,800
you are unaffected. You don't own the property,

214
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
but if you buy with the mortgage

215
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,400
and the price of the property goes up,

216
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,880
you take the, you take the profit, basically.

217
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,000
You take the upward movement in price.

218
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
And of course, in the last 30,

219
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,240
40 years, house prices in this country

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
and in most countries in the world have gone

221
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
very aggressively up

222
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,480
with only a few sort of downward hiccups,

223
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
which means that if you as an individual

224
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,640
have chosen to buy with a mortgage,

225
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,680
you would have done massively better

226
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,720
than if you have chosen to rent over the last 40 years.

227
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
But I think it's important

228
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,440
to realise the only real reason that

229
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,280
people have used mortgages

230
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,160
and paid interest

231
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,880
rather than people who have rented and paid rent have done

232
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,400
better is basically because prices have gone up

233
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
really aggressively.

234
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,800
If prices hadn't gone up

235
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,960
really aggressively., you'd be in

236
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,840
pretty much the exact same situation.

237
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
And I think it's worth

238
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,600
also recognising that if prices had gone down,

239
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,440
people who had bought with mortgages would have been

240
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,120
totally screwed.

241
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,280
If you buy a property with a big mortgage,

242
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,120
the price goes down.

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,520
You can become bankrupted extremely quickly.

244
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,920
This is what happened in Japan in the early nineties

245
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
when the housing market popped.

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,360
There was an enormous number of people

247
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
immediately bankrupted.

248
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
But I think it's

249
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
important to say I've said many times on this channel,

250
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,440
I think house prices will continue to go up.

251
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,200
So I'm not saying you shouldn't buy with mortgages,

252
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,720
but it's important to recognise that

253
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,080
both ways of doing it, buying with a mortgage or renting,

254
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,480
you will pay an enormous amount

255
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,200
of either rent or interest

256
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
to either

257
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
the guy who provided the loan or the owner of the house,

258
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,480
which is essentially the same thing.

259
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
There's no way of getting out of it,

260
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,160
If you do not own any wealth

261
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,560
and you want to live in a house,

262
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
you will pay these huge amounts of passive income,

263
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,160
either way. Using a mortgage or using rent.

264
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,560
The only difference is in one case you bear the price risk,

265
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,840
which is good if prices go up and they probably will,

266
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,120
but terrible if prices go down.

267
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
And the other way, you don't.

268
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,280
So I think the reason that this is important to understand

269
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,040
that rent, interest

270
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,840
and profits are the same thing

271
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,080
is because it helps us to recognise that underneath

272
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,200
these enormous amount of different cash flows,

273
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
which can take different names,

274
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,560
there exists a real country with real things.

275
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,280
There are

276
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,120
real houses, real commercial buildings,

277
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,480
there is real farmland, there are real natural resources.

278
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,360
And every time you use those things,

279
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
every time you live in a house,

280
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,800
every time you eat food, every time you use energy,

281
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,160
you are paying money to the owners

282
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,520
of those natural resources.

283
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,480
And whether it's called profits,

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
whether it's called interest, or whether it's called rent,

285
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,400
it's always the same thing, basically.

286
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
You as an individual

287
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,080
without wealth have to pay money to the individuals

288
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,560
who own the assets in order to basically live your life.

289
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,600
And this is essentially why

290
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
it's kind of inevitable that unless you

291
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,960
take some sort of preventative measures, wealth inequality

292
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,560
will and does tend to get higher over time.

293
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,880
And that's because, you know, you

294
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,560
as an individual,

295
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,760
you have an income of 30, 40 or 50 grand a year.

296
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,280
You spend the vast majority of that on

297
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,720
living in a house, eating food,

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,920
using energy, other essential costs.

299
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,040
And your salary goes in the form of profit, interest, rents

300
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,200
to the owners of the asset.

301
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,360
So after you've paid your essential costs,

302
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,280
you’re only maybe making,

303
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,040
you know, 10, 15 grand a year if you're lucky,

304
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,440
and the rest of your money has gone

305
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,680
to the owners of the assets.

306
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,800
So there's this massive constant drive of cash from the non

307
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
owners of assets, less rich people,

308
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,440
to the owners of assets, richer people.

309
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,520
And while that is happening,

310
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,680
these guys accumulate money

311
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
which they will inevitably use

312
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,280
to buy the rest of the assets.

313
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,760
So to conclude,

314
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,800
one of the big reasons I wanted to bring this up

315
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,640
is because I wanted people to realise that

316
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,320
because rent and interest are in many ways the same thing.

317
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,520
Owning property, but with

318
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,440
increasingly enormous amounts of debt

319
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,240
is very similar to not owning properties at all.

320
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
And the reason why it's important that you understand

321
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,200
this is generationally in this country,

322
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,080
whilst there is still a sort of big middle

323
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,880
class of property owners,

324
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
those property owners are increasingly needing

325
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,640
larger and larger amounts of debt

326
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,480
in order to own the properties.

327
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,840
So if we consider my granddad's generation, by 40

328
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,640
in many cases

329
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
they would have paid off the majority of their mortgage

330
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
and be close to owning their property.

331
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,160
Whereas my dad's generation

332
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,440
would probably be about halfway there by 40.

333
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,960
And my generation will, in many cases,

334
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,760
still having 90 or 80% mortgages

335
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,040
by the time they're 40 because they will

336
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,440
in many cases have only just bought.

337
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,920
And I think this ties in nicely to the video from last week

338
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
where we spoke about the illusion of improvement.

339
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,280
And the way that individuals

340
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,200
when they focus narrowly on their own

341
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,760
financial situation, may feel that they are improving,

342
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,040
whereas generationally

343
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,320
their family is getting poorer over time.

344
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,320
So individuals who own their own property with a mortgage,

345
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
they will be slowly paying their debt down

346
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,760
and they will often feel like I'm doing

347
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,960
when I'm getting richer without realising

348
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,360
that their children and grandchildren

349
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,520
are in a much worse situation,

350
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,360
largely because of the much higher property prices.

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
And will need to have much higher levels of debt.

352
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,560
So even though you

353
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
as individual are becoming less indebted over time,

354
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,920
you as a family are becoming more indebted over time.

355
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
This is really important to understand.

356
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,600
It's happening to our governments as well,

357
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
and governments are increasingly going in debt

358
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,000
to the rich, paying large amounts of interest to the rich.

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,960
Families are doing the same thing.

360
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,560
This is a big way that we lose our middle class

361
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,800
and our country falls into poverty.

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,760
So you need to be aware.

363
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,480
You need to understand interest,

364
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
rent, profits all the same thing.

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,400
Payments made

366
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
from poor people to rich people

367
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,360
that make wealth inequality get higher.

368
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
We're going to keep talking about it

369
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,200
until we understand it. Thank you very much.
