1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,400
Okay. Welcome back to Gary's Economics.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,280
Today, we are going to talk about

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,840
the changing shape of Great Britain.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,840
I've come down to Waterlooville

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,960
because I’m helping my Mum and Dad out with an eye tes,

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,960
but bloody hell.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,080
Like, this is definitely not what it was.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,600
I grew up around here.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,760
I used to sit on that cannon as a kid,

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,000
and I think a lot these shops, like,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,640
I remember I used to come and get my Pepe

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
jeans from one of these shops. But look at it.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,120
There's bloody nothing here.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,880
It's crazy.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,040
I want to talk about this.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,640
This phenomenon of the death of the smaller town.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
I've been thinking about this for a long time,

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,840
so a couple of years ago

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,720
in the winter, I went to Colombia for two months

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,440
because I wanted to practice my Spanish

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,480
and because I hate winter.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,640
So Colombia is a massive country, is about,

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,040
I think it's like five or six times bigger than the UK.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,440
It might even be more.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,360
And the population is a lot less than the UK,

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,720
just over half the UK. So

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,600
it's a big, low population density country.

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,640
It's a much poorer country than the UK.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,920
So I was expecting it to be quite rural, right?

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,560
There's a lot of space, there's a lot of farmland.

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
There's not that many people.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,840
I thought it would be like spread out,

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
you know, it’s a poorer country,

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,880
so there might be people, like, working in agriculture.

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,400
But I got there,

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,560
I flew into Bogotá

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,120
and straightaway Bogotá is like a massive city.

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,720
Bogotá is like, you know, it's almost as big as London,

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,360
it might even be as big as London.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
And I was quite surprised, right,

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,040
because you have much fewer people in the country,

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,680
but they've got a massive city the size of London.

43
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,840
And then after that, I took a bus to Medellín,

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,400
which is the second biggest city.

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,640
And then again you have another city which is

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,760
almost as big as London.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,160
So I was kind of like a little bit blown away by this,

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,080
like how can this country, massive country

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,680
with a relatively small population, have two cities

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,920
the size of London?

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,240
And it got me thinking about this quite a lot.

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,080
And the more I travelled in Latin America

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,560
and in other countries as well,

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
I started to realise that actually

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,520
this is quite commonly the shape

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,920
of like a relatively well developed

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,080
but very unequal country, which is that

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,320
you have a huge amount of farmland,

59
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
but it's largely industrialised

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
and not many people live in that farmland.

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,240
And all of the people then basically,

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,760
they have no jobs and they need jobs.

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,160
So they have to swarm basically

64
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,960
to where the rich people are

65
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,480
because the rich have all the money

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,640
and you end up with these sort of,

67
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,680
huge super cities

68
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,320
with a very, very wealthy centre and kind of large area

69
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,960
of essentially very low quality housing.

70
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,320
You could call it a slum around these these big cities.

71
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,040
And this is not unique to Colombia.

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
This is the situation

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,480
in most poorer,

74
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,880
most monarchical countries in the world. And

75
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,680
it basically got me

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,160
thinking about what the shape of a country is.

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,440
I think in capitalism, your country has to...

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,760
the physical shape of your country

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
has to reflect the wealth distribution of your country.

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
And if you look at Western European countries,

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,960
they have a different shape,

82
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,880
which is they have some big cities,

83
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,800
some smaller cities, and they have some towns,

84
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,440
they have some people living in rural settings.

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,520
It's much more diverse

86
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,000
than these extreme unequal countries

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
where increasingly the people live

88
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,600
in these slums around super cities.

89
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,120
And if you think about it, this makes sense, right?

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,600
Because if you have a relatively equal economy,

91
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,120
then every person in that economy is a small scale

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,080
wealth holder.

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,160
They are a worker and they're also a consumer.

94
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,800
And what that means is basically any

95
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,160
size settlement, is sustainable?

96
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,000
Because as long as you have a group of people there

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,960
you have

98
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,280
wealth holders, you have consumers,

99
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,080
and you have workers,

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
and everybody can work for each other

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,240
and everybody can consume each other's work.

102
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,000
So, you know, small cities are sustainable,

103
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,840
towns are sustainable, villages are sustainable

104
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,880
because everybody can work for each other.

105
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,720
But once you have a very unequal society,

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,960
then what you have is basically two kinds of people.

107
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,320
You have a very large group

108
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,200
of very poor people who need to work,

109
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,760
and you have a very small group of extremely wealthy

110
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,360
people who have an enormous amount of money to spend.

111
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,160
And what that means then is if you have

112
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,240
a group, a village,

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,800
which doesn't include any rich people,

114
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,480
you have a ton of workers and you have no employer,

115
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,920
you have no consumer.

116
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,160
So these small cities basically become,

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,520
they basically become non-viable, non sustainable.

118
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,200
And these cities have to essentially disband

119
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,360
and the people need to move towards

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
not even necessarily the big cities,

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,920
but wherever rich people exist.

122
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,840
And I think what we have in this country,

123
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
the UK and you also see in the US in places

124
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,400
like the Rust Belt and actually a lot of Europe,

125
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
I think what you have

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,280
is transitional countries

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,640
in the sense that we used to be a country

128
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,560
with a relatively large property owning middle class.

129
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,280
So these people lived in a variety

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,160
of different cities, big cities, small cities,

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
towns, and these places were sustaining.

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,720
But now we have moved

133
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,400
and we are continually moving into this more

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,640
Colombia type model.

135
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,320
You know, it's common across Latin America,

136
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,040
including the poor countries in Asia,

137
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,680
maybe some Eastern European countries.

138
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
We're moving to that very unequal model where

139
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,280
people need to live, where the rich people live.

140
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,800
So they need to move,

141
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,200
they need to move to these super cities.

142
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,960
And

143
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
you’re seeing that,

144
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
you're seeing the world basically split

145
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
into two kinds of places or places

146
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,920
where there are no rich people and places

147
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,800
where there are rich people.

148
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,920
And I think this is often described

149
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,960
by economists in a way

150
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,200
which I think is incorrect as an increasing...

151
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,480
such a classic economist way to describe a problem,

152
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
increasing preference towards large cities.

153
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,440
They say, well,

154
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,840
people just like large cities now, so

155
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,800
everybody's moving to large cities.

156
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,040
But I think this doesn't really

157
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
fit the model right,

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,720
because if you look at a place like

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,240
Newcastle, Newcastle is a large city,

160
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,680
Glasgow is a large city.

161
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
These are cities where there's

162
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,080
increasing economic deprivation and people are leaving.

163
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,880
Whereas if you look at a place like

164
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,480
Cambridge or Oxford,

165
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,640
these are small cities

166
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
and yet these are places

167
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,000
where people are moving to the cities

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,360
and where housing is extraordinarily expensive.

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,200
If you look at, for example,

170
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
the Swiss Alps or the Hamptons,

171
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,320
a popular holiday destination

172
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,480
in the states for wealthy people,

173
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
these are not big cities

174
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,120
and they're becoming very expensive.

175
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,240
So actually what you are seeing is people flooding

176
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,680
from the country to wherever rich people are.

177
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,320
And that is what you have to do

178
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,400
when countries become more unequal.

179
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,960
I think we are moving

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,840
from the physical shape of an equal country

181
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,320
to the physical shape of an unequal country.

182
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,920
And you also see that in big cities.

183
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,400
So I'm from London, I come from Ilford in East London.

184
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
And

185
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,320
this is a place

186
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
where people are swarming to this place.

187
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,280
And one of the most common

188
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,440
solutions that is put forward to the housing crisis is

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
you have to build more houses,

190
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
you have to build more houses.

191
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
And

192
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm from Ilford and people from other,

193
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,240
sort of, more distant suburbs, poorer

194
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,720
suburbs of London

195
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,480
will be very aware that in these places

196
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,320
enormous amounts of housing is being built.

197
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,360
And if you go to the street I grew up on,

198
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,080
the density has increased enormously.

199
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,240
All of the houses have been expanded upwards,

200
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,560
all the houses have been expanded backwards.

201
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
There was a factory at the end of the street

202
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,360
which has been knocked down

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
and replaced with a massive block of flats.

204
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,440
And these

205
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,040
are providing extremely low quality housing

206
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,160
because these cities are increasingly full of extremely

207
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,360
poor people.

208
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,440
And I think

209
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm not opposed to building more houses, but I think

210
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,880
unequal economies,

211
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,560
the shape of these countries

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
is basically enormous slums around the wealthy centers.

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
And that,

214
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,280
because our economy

215
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,200
is becoming a very unequal economy,

216
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,920
that is what our country wants

217
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,520
to become like from a capitalist perspective.

218
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,800
So if we build more houses

219
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
under this situation of high and growing inequality,

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,680
we will build that physical slum space.

221
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,960
If you go back to Ilford,

222
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,320
especially the part of Ilford I'm from,

223
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
that is what it's becoming.

224
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,520
So I think when I see this video,

225
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,120
what I see is a transitional country.

226
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,320
You know, we used to be a middle class country

227
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,440
and we are becoming a very highly unequal country.

228
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,840
And highly unequal countries

229
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,240
don't have cute little towns for ordinary people.

230
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,640
They have slums for ordinary people.

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
And if you go to,

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,920
you know, if you go to highly unequal countries,

233
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,600
like most of the countries in Latin America, you know,

234
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
you go to Mexico City, you'll see the same thing.

235
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,120
People are forced out of the countryside.

236
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,720
The countryside gets,

237
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,880
you know, industrialised from a farming perspective.

238
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,760
Some of it gets kept as playgrounds for the rich

239
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,960
and people swarm to the big cities and

240
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm very skeptical that building

241
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,080
will solve the problem.

242
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,800
I lived in Tokyo for two years,

243
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,480
and that is a city with 38 million people

244
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
and very unaffordable housing.

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
I think poverty is the problem.

246
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,840
You know, if you don't get money

247
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
in ordinary people's pockets,

248
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,000
then everybody has to live close to the rich people

249
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,080
and there are fewer and fewer rich people

250
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,080
and those people are richer and richer. So

251
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,800
I think unless you fix the wealth distribution,

252
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,920
then this video of emptying out

253
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,320
small towns is the future of this country,

254
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
But not just this country,

255
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
but also America and also most of Europe.

256
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,320
And I don't want it to go that way.

257
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,080
And one solution is we build more housing in London

258
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,800
and we turn London into the super slum it's becoming.

259
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,680
And another solution is

260
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,920
we get money in people's pockets and allow people

261
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,840
to live where their families have lived in 100...

262
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,760
for hundreds of years

263
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,440
because they can afford to work for each other.

264
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,480
And that's the future

265
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,720
which I'd rather have for this country, for America

266
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,040
and for the rest of Europe. We can do it.

267
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,480
But we can only do it if we deal with inequality.

268
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,000
And the only way to deal with inequality

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
is to tax the rich.

270
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
So we're going to campaign for it, we’re here

271
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,560
every week. Thank you for your support.
