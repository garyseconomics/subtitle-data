00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,960
Welcome back to Gary’s Economics.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,960
Today we are going to talk about why growth is stupid.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,240
Okay, this is a thing

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
which I've been thinking about for a while.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,440
And, it was prompted this week by an article

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,360
which I read in the New Yorker,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,720
a good long article about British economics,

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,960
by a guy with Sam Knight

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,480
where he talks

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,400
about basically the collapse of the British economy,

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,920
the collapse of British politics.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,040
A lot of people are looking at us saying,

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,600
what's going on in Britain. It's falling apart.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,960
And he interviewed a guy called Mark Carney,

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,720
who is a former governor of the Bank of England.

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,280
He was a governor of the Bank of England back

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,680
when I was a trader.

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,160
And Mark Carney

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,400
had this very pithy way

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,080
of describing the British economy

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,240
and the British economic problem.

22
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,040
And I've got the exact quote here.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,280
What he said was, it's just not that productive

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
an economy anymore.

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,680
This is Mark Carney, former

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,480
head of the Bank of England.

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
The problem with Britain is that it

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
is just not that productive an economy.

29
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,840
And we hear these kinds of arguments

30
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,680
all the time on the news,

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
from the Conservative Party, sometimes

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,800
even the Labour Party.

33
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,440
The problem with Britain is

34
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,840
we're just not productive enough.

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,200
We as Britain's have a fundamental problem,

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,640
our productivity is lacking,

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,040
we're sort of fundamentally weak,

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,120
we need to fix productivity.

39
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,440
And

40
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,800
I have a problem with this way

41
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,680
of describing the economy.

42
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,080
First of all, I'm not against productivity.

43
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm not against economic growth.

44
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,960
I think these things are all good things.

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,640
If fundamentally the biggest problem was a lack of UK

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,200
productivity,

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
number one, what we'd be seeing is living

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
standards falling specifically in the UK.

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,400
And I think a lot of people who live in the UK

50
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,000
feel that what we have is a specific UK problem.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's very important to recognise

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,880
living standards are falling for middle

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,320
classes all across the world, all across the world.

54
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
So this YouTube

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,440
channel is watched all across the world.

56
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,560
We've got a lot of viewers

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,320
in America, in Australia and places like Germany,

58
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
the Netherlands.

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,760
We get messages all the time saying

60
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,360
living standards are collapsing here

61
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,960
in the US, in Germany, it's

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
definitely happening in places

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,760
like Italy and Spain, even a country like Australia,

64
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,960
which is generally considered to have

65
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,880
strong living standards,

66
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
a good place to live, living

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
standards are falling there.

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
So if the problem was specifically UK productivity,

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,640
and I'm not saying

70
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,760
we don't have a problem with productivity,

71
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,360
if that was the main problem,

72
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,760
why are living standards

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
collapsing all across the world?

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
The second thing is to say,

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
if the problem was a lack of growth in productivity,

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,920
and I'm not saying

77
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,240
we don't have a lack of growth in productivity,

78
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,480
why are living standards falling?

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,080
So in the last five years specifically,

80
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,360
we have seen really a collapse

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
in the living standards of the average British family.

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,960
This has happened at the same time

83
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,280
as enormous growth in inequality.

84
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,000
We've reached a situation now when,

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,880
you know, about half of the families

86
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,920
in the country

87
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,480
struggle to simultaneously feed their kids

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,320
and turn the heating on in the winter.

89
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,080
And this has not coincided

90
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,480
with the collapse in British productivity.

91
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
Yeah, we can argue that a stagnation

92
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,480
in British productivity,

93
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,960
but productivity is not collapsing

94
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,240
and yet living standards are collapsing.

95
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,280
So again, we have a second disconnected.

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,200
The third thing, and I think

97
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,360
the most important disconnect is

98
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,640
if the fundamental problem

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,560
in the British economy

100
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,920
or even the global economy is a lack of productivity,

101
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,800
why is wealth of the richest people in the country,

102
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
the richest people in the world,

103
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,080
millionaires and billionaires,

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,880
why are these people's wealth

105
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,240
exploding through the ceiling?

106
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,160
So I'm sitting here now.

107
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,800
We're filming this at the beginning of April.

108
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,920
In the last couple of weeks,

109
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,800
we have seen

110
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,440
almost every single stock market in the entire world,

111
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,800
hit a new record all time high.

112
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,360
Does that sound like a world

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,960
which has a problem of fundamental productivity growth?

114
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,200
So we saw

115
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,480
another piece of news that came out yesterday

116
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,360
was that the world

117
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,400
gains 141 new billionaires

118
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,680
last year, and an amazing year for rich people.

119
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,720
I always remember

120
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,360
in the middle of the depths

121
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,400
of the cost of living crisis,

122
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,360
the Financial Times ran an article

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,520
and the headline was ‘Will

124
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,000
the boom in luxury goods ever stop?’

125
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
That was the article.

126
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,400
You know, we saw in the first year of Covid,

127
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,840
the largest and fastest ever increasing wealth

128
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,480
of the richest people in the country.

129
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,840
We saw the average US billionaire double their wealth

130
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,760
in a single year.

131
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,680
The average UK billionaire made £630 million

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,120
in a single year.

133
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Does this sound to you

134
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,520
like a country and a world

135
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,760
where the fundamental problem is productivity growth?

136
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
And I'll keep saying I'm

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
not against productivity growth, productivity is great.

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
If you live in a country and a world

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
where living standards of ordinary people

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,840
are collapsing

141
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,400
and living standards of the richest

142
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
are exploding through the roof,

143
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,000
stock markets are exploding to new all time highs.

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
The gold price hit a massive

145
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,840
new all time high yesterday.

146
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,200
Do you really think the problem is productivity growth?

147
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,840
Do you not think there might be a deeper problem

148
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,520
with inequality?

149
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
So I think we need to look a little bit closer

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
at who this guy Mark Carney is right.

151
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
So Mark Carney as I've said,

152
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,920
was former head of the Bank of England.

153
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,440
He's actually a Canadian, he's not British.

154
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,360
Before that he was head of the Bank of Canada,

155
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,000
and before that he was a very well paid banker

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,720
for Goldman Sachs.

157
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,480
So what you have here is a very wealthy man

158
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,920
who has been very well paid throughout his career.

159
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm sure him and his family are all very rich.

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,080
They are part of a class of very wealthy

161
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,280
people who are getting richer

162
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,960
very rapidly, who’s living standards are increasing

163
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
very rapidly.

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,480
Turning around to you and saying

165
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,880
the problem is productivity.

166
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,320
You guys are just not productive enough.

167
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,400
And I think what we have here

168
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,040
is one single example of a much broader problem,

169
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
which is that economists and politicians who

170
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,280
very often are very rich,

171
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,040
live in an economy which is

172
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,360
seeing lifestyles of the very rich get

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,440
fantastically better.

174
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,080
Seeing the wealth of the very rich explode very quickly

175
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
while your living standards collapse,

176
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,480
turning around to you and saying

177
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,040
the problem is your productivity.

178
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,760
And let's unwrap

179
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
a little bit what productivity is,

180
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
because I think productivity

181
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,640
sounds like a very moralistic term.

182
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,680
Productivity is basically GDP per worker,

183
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
or sometimes it's GDP per hour worked.

184
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,080
So essentially,

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,160
unless, you know,

186
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
people are working rapidly more hours,

187
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,440
which in the UK they are,

188
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,760
essentially it comes down to GDP growth.

189
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,000
And these guys are basically saying

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
the reason you're poor

191
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
is because GDP growth is not high enough.

192
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,080
And first to say GDP is not falling.

193
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,040
GDP of the UK

194
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,960
now is higher than it was before Covid,

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,320
GDP of almost every Western country is higher

196
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,160
now than it was before Covid.

197
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
GDP is enormously higher than it was 30,

198
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,240
40, 50 years ago

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,960
when people like my dad, possibly

200
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,280
your dad were able to work regular jobs and buy houses.

201
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,520
GDP goes up and up and up and up and up.

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,240
The wealth of the richest goes up and up and up.

203
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,200
Living standards for the rich go up and up and up.

204
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,560
Ordinary people are really getting poorer very rapidly.

205
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,840
And wealthy men like Mark Carney

206
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
turn around and say it's

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,200
because your productivity is not good enough.

208
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,360
We had a very similar example where Andrew Bailey,

209
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,360
who is the current governor of the Bank of England,

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,400
said that inflation is your fault

211
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,880
for asking for high wages

212
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,240
and Andrew Bailey is paid £500,000 a year.

213
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,280
We have an increasing problem of economists

214
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
trying to tell you

215
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,480
that it's your fault

216
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,280
and in many cases even saying it's not happening.

217
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,040
There was a conservative politician on TV

218
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,320
just last week

219
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,120
saying that

220
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,360
living standards are better than they've ever been.

221
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,200
It's very, very important

222
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,520
that people like you understand inequality is growing

223
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,280
and inequality is growing very quickly.

224
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,640
And when inequality grows quickly,

225
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
living standards for the rich increase

226
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,520
and living standards for the poor fall.

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,640
Economists have a fundamental blindspot

228
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,880
about inequality.

229
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,800
What they are obsessed about is growth.

230
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
And they will always be obsessed about growth,

231
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,160
and they will always tell you

232
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,600
that growth is the problem

233
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
and lack of productivity is the problem.

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
In my opinion,

235
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,120
and I've got lots of videos

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,440
where I hope I’ll convince you,

237
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,280
we have a fundamental problem of growing inequality.

238
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,320
And what I see is a sick economy

239
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
which has a growing cancer of inequality.

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,040
Going to the doctor and the doctor

241
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,600
saying, listen, don't worry about your cancer.

242
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,640
Grow your way out of it.

243
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,440
Listen, we grow year after year

244
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,200
and living standards fall

245
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,400
and it's not going to work.

246
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,120
And growth is great,

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
but I think it has become basically

248
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
a mantra, basically

249
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,920
a prayer of our intellectual classes,

250
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,360
which is don't worry about anything else, just grow.

251
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,280
Just grow.

252
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,880
And I think it's basically reached the point

253
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,520
where growth has become essentially a codeword

254
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,200
from the very rich, which is I'm an idiot.

255
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,560
I don't understand this problem.

256
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,760
I have no real solutions, but just f**king grow

257
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,840
with no plan.

258
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,640
We're in this absolutely absurd

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,320
situation in this country where

260
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,520
we have a conservative government

261
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,400
whose plan is just grow,

262
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,880
whilst absolutely starving

263
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
people and government of the funds

264
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,840
they need to provide any sort of growth.

265
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,600
We have a Labour government are going to come in

266
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,840
and their plan is we're going to grow the economy

267
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,360
without doing any investment,

268
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,400
without putting any money in your pockets.

269
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,240
I think growth has become

270
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,560
such a meaningless word that it's just something

271
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,280
economists and politicians scream

272
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,240
about with no real plan.

273
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,040
I would like you

274
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
to turn around to these economists

275
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
and these politicians and ask them with what money?

276
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,200
What money do you want us to grow with?

277
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,160
If we have no money to go out

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,400
to our shops, to our high streets, and to spend,

279
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,360
then where is the economic growth going to come from?

280
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,480
And if the problem is a lack of growth,

281
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,640
then why do the wealths

282
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,080
of the richest people in our country

283
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
and the richest people of the world

284
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,040
keep growing more and more?

285
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
So

286
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,280
I would like to leave you with a message

287
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,720
that growth in our modern age,

288
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,400
as much it would be wonderful,

289
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,600
has become basically a signal of stupidity.

290
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,160
People with no plans, people with no understanding of

291
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,680
the problem of growing inequality,

292
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,160
are insisting that the problem

293
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,880
is our lack of economic growth.

294
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,120
we won't go anywhere good

295
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,320
when all the money goes to the rich

296
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,600
and nothing goes to anybody else.

297
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
People like Mark Carney, people like Andrew Bailey,

298
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,400
people like our very wealthy politicians,

299
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,720
they're not going to do anything about it.

300
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,560
It has to be you. It has to be me.

301
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,320
We have to scream at these politicians and say,

302
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,040
the problem is not economic growth.

303
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
The problem is growth of inequality of wealth.

304
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,880
If you don't fix it,

305
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,160
our living standards will collapse.

306
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
So I’ll keep making videos about it,

307
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,520
if you keep talking about it.

308
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
It's not growth,

309
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,360
it's not Mark Carney, it’s inequality stupid.

310
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
We have to fix it. Thank you.
